	abstract = {Accurate and prior identification of local severe storm systems in pre-convection environments using geostationary satellite imagery measurements is a challenging task. Methodologies for \&ldquo;convective initiation\&rdquo; identification have already been developed and explored for operational nowcasting applications; however, warning of such convective systems using the new generation of geostationary satellite imagery measurements in pre-convection environments is still not well studied. In this investigation, the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm is used to develop a predictive statistical model for tracking and identifying three different types of convective storm systems (weak, medium, and severe) over East Asia by combining spatially-temporally collocated Himawari-8 (H08) measurements and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecast data. The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) gridded product is used as a benchmark to train the predictive models based on a sample-balance technique which can adjust or balance the samples of three different convection types to avoid over-fitting any type of dataset. Variables such as brightness temperatures (BTs) from H08 water vapor absorption bands (6.2 \&mu;m, 6.9 \&mu;m and 7.3 \&mu;m) and Total Precipitable Water (TPW) from NWP show relatively high ranks in the predictive model training. These sensitive variables are closely associated with convectively dominated precipitation areas, indicating the importance of predictors from both H08 and NWP data. The final optimal RF model is achieved with an accuracy of 0.79 for classification of all convective storm systems, while the Probability of Detection (POD) of this model for severe and medium convections can reach 0.66 and 0.70, respectively. Two typical sudden convective storm cases in the warm season of 2018 tracked by this algorithm are described, and results indicate that the H08 and NWP based statistical model using the RF algorithm is capable of capturing local burst convective storm systems about 1\&ndash;2 h earlier than the outbreak of heavy rainfall.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

With this in mind, the multi-institutional North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) project has produced retrospective (1996–2002) and real-time (1999–present) data sets to support its LSM modeling activities. Featuring 0.125° spatial resolution, hourly temporal resolution, nine primary forcing fields, and six secondary validation/model development fields, each data set is based on a backbone of Eta Data Assimilation System/Eta data and is supplemented with observation-based precipitation and radiation data. Hourly observation-based precipitation data are derived from a combination of daily National Center for Environmental Prediction Climate Prediction Center (CPC) gauge-based precipitation analyses and hourly National Weather Service Doppler radar-based (WSR-88D) precipitation analyses, wherein the hourly radar-based analyses are used to temporally disaggregate the daily CPC analyses. NLDAS observation-based shortwave values are derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite radiation data processed at the University of Maryland and at the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service. Extensive quality control and validation efforts have been conducted on the NLDAS forcing data sets, and favorable comparisons have taken place with Oklahoma Mesonet, Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program/cloud and radiation test bed, and Surface Radiation observation data. The real-time forcing data set is constantly evolving to make use of the latest advances in forcing-related data sets, and all of the real-time and retrospective data are available online at http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov for visualization and downloading in both full and subset forms.},

	abstract = {Abstract In the last decade, much work in atmospheric science has focused on spatial verification (SV) methods for gridded prediction, which overcome serious disadvantages of pixelwise verification. However, neural networks (NN) in atmospheric science are almost always trained to optimize pixelwise loss functions, even when ultimately assessed with SV methods. This establishes a disconnect between model verification during versus after training. To address this issue, we develop spatially enhanced loss functions (SELF) and demonstrate their use for a real-world problem: predicting the occurrence of thunderstorms (henceforth, “convection”) with NNs. In each SELF we use either a neighborhood filter, which highlights convection at scales larger than a threshold, or a spectral filter (employing Fourier or wavelet decomposition), which is more flexible and highlights convection at scales between two thresholds. We use these filters to spatially enhance common verification scores, such as the Brier score. We train each NN with a different SELF and compare their performance at many scales of convection, from discrete storm cells to tropical cyclones. Among our many findings are that (i) for a low or high risk threshold, the ideal SELF focuses on small or large scales, respectively; (ii) models trained with a pixelwise loss function perform surprisingly well; and (iii) nevertheless, models trained with a spectral filter produce much better-calibrated probabilities than a pixelwise model. We provide a general guide to using SELFs, including technical challenges and the final Python code, as well as demonstrating their use for the convection problem. To our knowledge this is the most in-depth guide to SELFs in the geosciences. Significance Statement Gridded predictions, in which a quantity is predicted at every pixel in space, should be verified with spatially aware methods rather than pixel by pixel. Neural networks (NN), which are often used for gridded prediction, are trained to minimize an error value called the loss function. NN loss functions in atmospheric science are almost always pixelwise, which causes the predictions to miss rare events and contain unrealistic spatial patterns. We use spatial filters to enhance NN loss functions, and we test our novel spatially enhanced loss functions (SELF) on thunderstorm prediction. We find that different SELFs work better for different scales (i.e., different-sized thunderstorm complexes) and that spectral filters, one of the two filter types, produce unexpectedly well calibrated thunderstorm probabilities.},

This paper describes the development of a multilayer soil characteristics dataset for the conterminous United States (CONUS-SOIL) that specifically addresses the need for soil physical and hydraulic property information over large areas. The State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO) developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture–Natural Resources Conservation Service served as the starting point for CONUS-SOIL. Geographic information system and Perl computer programming language tools were used to create map coverages of soil properties including soil texture and rock fragment classes, depth-to-bedrock, bulk density, porosity, rock fragment volume, particle-size (sand, silt, and clay) fractions, available water capacity, and hydrologic soil group. Interpolation procedures for the continuous and categorical variables describing these soil properties were developed and applied to the original STATSGO data. In addition to any interpolation errors, the CONUS-SOIL dataset reflects the limitations of the procedures used to generate detailed county-level soil survey data to the STATSGO map units. CONUS-SOIL is available in several formats and may be accessed via the World Wide Web.},

By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.},

LIS employs the use of scalable, high performance computing and data management technologies to deal with the computational challenges of high resolution land surface modeling. To make the LIS products transparently available to the end users, LIS includes a number of highly interactive visualization components as well. The LIS components are designed using object-oriented principles, with flexible, adaptable interfaces and modular structures for rapid prototyping and development. In addition, the interoperable features in LIS enable the definition, intercomparison, and validation of land surface modeling standards and the reuse of a high quality land surface modeling and computing system.},

Deep-learning-based hyperspectral data analysis methodologies have made significant advancements over the past few years. Despite their success, most deep learning frameworks for hyperspectral data classification tend to suffer in terms of computational and classification efficacy as the data size increases. This is largely due to their equal emphasis criteria on the rich spectral information present in the data, albeit all of the spectral information not being essential for hyperspectral data analysis. On the contrary, this redundant information present in the spectral bands can deter the performance of hyperspectral data analysis techniques. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel bidirectional spectral attention mechanism, which is computationally efficient and capable of adaptive spectral information diversification through selective emphasis on spectral bands that comprise more information and suppress the ones with lesser information. The concept of 3D-convolutions in tandem with bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) is used in the proposed architecture as spectral attention mechanism. A feedforward neural network (FNN)-based supervised classification is then performed to validate the performance of our proposed approach. Experimental results reveal that the proposed hyperspectral data analysis model with spectral attention mechanism outperforms other spatial- and spectral-information-extraction-based hyperspectral data analysis techniques compared.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral remote sensing presents a unique Big Data research paradigm through its rich data collected as hundreds of spectral bands which embodies vital spatial and spectral information about the underlying terrains. Typical hyperspectral data analysis methods are often based on spectral information. Although there has been prior efforts in literature for incorporation of spatial, spectral, contextual and other forms of information to improve the classification performance of hyperspectral data analysis, this additional information extraction and knowledge discovery process comes at the expense of increased computation and memory requirements. Therefore, the caveats of large scale data analysis such as increased computation, transmission and memory requirements presents a major impediment to efficient automation and classification performance of hyperspectral data analysis methods. In this respect, this paper presents a novel deep learning-based hyperspectral data analysis model, which provides an efficient means for automation and extraction of the spatial and spectral information present in the hyperspectral data compared to conventional spatial-or spectral information-only based methods. In this work, the concept of Gabor filtering is used for spatial feature extraction along with sparse random projections for computationally efficient spectral feature extraction and dimensionality reduction purposes. A convolutional neural network based supervised classification is then performed to validate the performance of the proposed method with respect to conventional spatial-spectral information extraction methods. Experimental results reveal that the proposed hyperspectral data analysis model outperforms the conventional spectral-spatial feature extraction techniques compared.},

In spite of their effectiveness, given that hyperspectral images are of high dimensionality, CNNs can be hindered by their modeling of all spectral bands with the same weight, as probably not all bands are equally informative and predictive. Moreover, the usage of useless spectral bands in CNNs may even introduce noises and weaken the performance of networks. For the sake of boosting the representational capacity of CNNs for spectral-spatial hyperspectral data classification, in this work, we improve networks by discriminating the significance of different spectral bands. We design a network unit, which is termed as the spectral attention module, that makes use of a gating mechanism to adaptively recalibrate spectral bands by selectively emphasizing informative bands and suppressing less useful ones. We theoretically analyze and discuss why such a spectral attention module helps in a CNN for hyperspectral image classification. We demonstrate using extensive experiments that in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, the spectral attention module-based convolutional networks are able to offer competitive results. Furthermore, this work sheds light on how a CNN interacts with spectral bands for the purpose of classification.},

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

	abstract = {Recently, deep learning-based classification approaches have made great progress and now dominate a wide range of applications, thanks to their Herculean discriminative feature learning ability. Despite their success, for hyperspectral data analysis, these deep learning based techniques tend to suffer computationally as the magnitude of the data soars. This is mainly because the hyperspectral imagery (HSI) data are multidimensional, as well as giving equal importance to the large amount of temporal and spatial information in the HSI data, despite the redundancy of information in the temporal and spatial domains. Consequently, in literature, this equal information emphasis has proven to affect the classification efficacy negatively in addition to increasing the computational time. As a result, this paper proposes a novel dual branch spatial-spectral attention based classification methodology that is computationally cheap and capable of selectively accentuating cardinal spatial and spectral features while suppressing less useful ones. The theory of feature extraction with 3D-convolutions alongside a gated mechanism for feature weighting using bi-directional long short-term memory is used as a spectral attention mechanism in this architecture. In addition, a union of 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) and a residual network oriented spatial window-based attention mechanism is proposed in this work. To validate the efficacy of our proposed technique, the features collected from these spatial and spectral attention pipelines are transferred to a feed-forward neural network (FNN) for supervised pixel-wise classification of HSI data. The suggested spatial-spectral attention based hyperspectral data analysis and image classification methodology outperform other spatial-only, spectral-only, and spatial-spectral feature extraction based hyperspectral image classification methodologies when compared, according to experimental results.},

We assess whether or not silicon chemistry meets the requirements for chemical diversity and reactivity as compared to carbon. To expand the possibility of plausible silicon biochemistry, we explore silicon’s chemical complexity in diverse solvents found in planetary environments, including water, cryosolvents, and sulfuric acid. In no environment is a life based primarily around silicon chemistry a plausible option. We find that in a water-rich environment silicon’s chemical capacity is highly limited due to ubiquitous silica formation; silicon can likely only be used as a rare and specialized heteroatom. Cryosolvents (e.g., liquid N2) provide extremely low solubility of all molecules, including organosilicons. Sulfuric acid, surprisingly, appears to be able to support a much larger diversity of organosilicon chemistry than water.},

	abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

	abstract = {Results are presented from the multi-institution partnership to develop a real-time and retrospective North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS). NLDAS consists of (1) four land models executing in parallel in uncoupled mode, (2) common hourly surface forcing, and (3) common streamflow routing: all using a 1/8° grid over the continental United States. The initiative is largely sponsored by the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Continental-Scale International Project (GCIP). As the overview for nine NLDAS papers, this paper describes and evaluates the 3-year NLDAS execution of 1 October 1996 to 30 September 1999, a period rich in observations for validation. The validation emphasizes (1) the land states, fluxes, and input forcing of four land models, (2) the application of new GCIP-sponsored products, and (3) a multiscale approach. The validation includes (1) mesoscale observing networks of land surface forcing, fluxes, and states, (2) regional snowpack measurements, (3) daily streamflow measurements, and (4) satellite-based retrievals of snow cover, land surface skin temperature (LST), and surface insolation. The results show substantial intermodel differences in surface evaporation and runoff (especially over nonsparse vegetation), soil moisture storage, snowpack, and LST. Owing to surprisingly large intermodel differences in aerodynamic conductance, intermodel differences in midday summer LST were unlike those expected from the intermodel differences in Bowen ratio. Last, anticipating future assimilation of LST, an NLDAS effort unique to this overview paper assesses geostationary-satellite-derived LST, determines the latter to be of good quality, and applies the latter to validate modeled LST.},

	abstract = {North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) land surface models have been run for a retrospective period forced by atmospheric observations from the Eta analysis and actual precipitation and downward solar radiation to calculate land hydrology. We evaluated these simulations using in situ observations over the southern Great Plains for the periods of May–September of 1998 and 1999 by comparing the model outputs with surface latent, sensible, and ground heat fluxes at 24 Atmospheric Radiation Measurement/Cloud and Radiation Testbed stations and with soil temperature and soil moisture observations at 72 Oklahoma Mesonet stations. The standard NLDAS models do a fairly good job but with differences in the surface energy partition and in soil moisture between models and observations and among models during the summer, while they agree quite well on the soil temperature simulations. To investigate why, we performed a series of experiments accounting for differences between model-specified soil types and vegetation and those observed at the stations, and differences in model treatment of different soil types, vegetation properties, canopy resistance, soil column depth, rooting depth, root density, snow-free albedo, infiltration, aerodynamic resistance, and soil thermal diffusivity. The diagnosis and model enhancements demonstrate how the models can be improved so that they can be used in actual data assimilation mode.},

This approach proved to be very beneficial to understanding the performance and limitations of different land surface models. These four surface models, embodying different complexities of the evaporation/hydrology treatment, included the traditional simple bucket model, the simple water balance (SWB) model, the Oregon State University (OSU) model, and the simplified Simple Biosphere (SSiB) model. The bucket model overestimated the evaporation during wet periods, and this resulted in unrealistically large negative sensible heat fluxes. The SWB model, despite its simple evaporation formulation, simulated well the evaporation during wet periods, but it tended to underestimate the evaporation during dry periods. Overall, the OSU model ably simulated the observed seasonal and diurnal variation in evaporation, soil moisture, sensible heat flux, and surface skin temperature. The more complex SSiB model performed similarly to the OSU model. A range of sensitivity experiments showed that some complexity in the canopy resistance scheme is important in reducing both the overestimation of evaporation during wet periods and underestimation during dry periods. Properly parameterizing not only the effect of soil moisture stress but also other canopy resistance factors, such as the vapor pressure deficit stress, is critical for canopy resistance evaluation. An overly simple canopy resistance that includes only soil moisture stress is unable to simulate observed surface evaporation during dry periods. Given a modestly comprehensive time-dependent canopy resistance treatment, a rather simple surface model such as the OSU model can provide good area-averaged surface heat fluxes for mesoscale atmospheric models.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of Transformer-based solutions for the long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) task. Despite the growing performance over the past few years, we question the validity of this line of research in this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence. However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some ordering information, the nature of the {\textbackslash}emph\{permutation-invariant\} self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss. To validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer linear models named LTSF-Linear for comparison. Experimental results on nine real-life datasets show that LTSF-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models in all cases, and often by a large margin. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to explore the impacts of various design elements of LTSF models on their temporal relation extraction capability. We hope this surprising finding opens up new research directions for the LTSF task. We also advocate revisiting the validity of Transformer-based solutions for other time series analysis tasks (e.g., anomaly detection) in the future.

	abstract = {A reliable and efficient representation of multivariate time series is crucial in various downstream machine learning tasks. In multivariate time series forecasting, each variable depends on its historical values and there are inter-dependencies among variables as well. Models have to be designed to capture both intra- and inter-relationships among the time series. To move towards this goal, we propose the Time Series Attention Transformer (TSAT) for multivariate time series representation learning. Using TSAT, we represent both temporal information and inter-dependencies of multivariate time series in terms of edge-enhanced dynamic graphs. The intra-series correlations are represented by nodes in a dynamic graph; a self-attention mechanism is modified to capture the inter-series correlations by using the super-empirical mode decomposition (SMD) module. We applied the embedded dynamic graphs to times series forecasting problems, including two real-world datasets and two benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that TSAT clearly outerperforms six state-of-the-art baseline methods in various forecasting horizons. We further visualize the embedded dynamic graphs to illustrate the graph representation power of TSAT. We share our code at https://github.com/RadiantResearch/TSAT.},

            Currently, most real-world time series datasets are multivariate and are rich in dynamical information of the underlying system. Such datasets are attracting much attention; therefore, the need for accurate modelling of such high-dimensional datasets is increasing. Recently, the deep architecture of the recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variant long short-term memory (LSTM) have been proven to be more accurate than traditional statistical methods in modelling time series data. Despite the reported advantages of the deep LSTM model, its performance in modelling multivariate time series (MTS) data has not been satisfactory, particularly when attempting to process highly non-linear and long-interval MTS datasets. The reason is that the supervised learning approach initializes the neurons randomly in such recurrent networks, disabling the neurons that ultimately must properly learn the latent features of the correlated variables included in the MTS dataset. In this paper, we propose a pre-trained LSTM-based stacked autoencoder (LSTM-SAE) approach in an unsupervised learning fashion to replace the random weight initialization strategy adopted in deep LSTM recurrent networks. For evaluation purposes, two different case studies that include real-world datasets are investigated, where the performance of the proposed approach compares favourably with the deep LSTM approach. In addition, the proposed approach outperforms several reference models investigating the same case studies. Overall, the experimental results clearly show that the unsupervised pre-training approach improves the performance of deep LSTM and leads to better and faster convergence than other models.},

	abstract = {We investigate recurrent neural network architectures for event-sequence processing. Event sequences, characterized by discrete observations stamped with continuous-valued times of occurrence, are challenging due to the potentially wide dynamic range of relevant time scales as well as interactions between time scales. We describe four forms of inductive bias that should benefit architectures for event sequences: temporal locality, position and scale homogeneity, and scale interdependence. We extend the popular gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture to incorporate these biases via intrinsic temporal dynamics, obtaining a continuous-time GRU. The CT-GRU arises by interpreting the gates of a GRU as selecting a time scale of memory, and the CT-GRU generalizes the GRU by incorporating multiple time scales of memory and performing context-dependent selection of time scales for information storage and retrieval. Event time-stamps drive decay dynamics of the CT-GRU, whereas they serve as generic additional inputs to the GRU. Despite the very different manner in which the two models consider time, their performance on eleven data sets we examined is essentially identical. Our surprising results point both to the robustness of GRU and LSTM architectures for handling continuous time, and to the potency of incorporating continuous dynamics into neural architectures.},

We use warm season, high-frequency, near-surface states and turbulent fluxes collected over nine sites in the U.S. Southern Great Plains. We quantify changes in the pattern of sensitive parameters, the amount and nature of the interaction between parameters, and the covariance structure of the distribution of behavioral parameter sets. Using Sobol′'s total and first-order sensitivity indexes, we show that few parameters directly control the variance of the model response. Significant parameter interaction occurs. Optimal parameter values differ between models, and the relationships between parameters also change. GW decreases unwarranted parameter interaction and appears to improve model realism, especially at wetter study sites. DV increases parameter interaction and decreases identifiability, implying it is overparameterized and/or underconstrained. At a wet site, GW has two functional modes: one that mimics STD and a second in which GW improves model function by decoupling direct evaporation and base flow. Unsupervised classification of the posterior distributions of behavioral parameter sets cannot group similar sites based solely on soil or vegetation type, helping to explain why transferability between sites and models is not straightforward. Our results suggest that the a priori assignment of parameters should also consider the climatic conditions of a study location.},

In transductive learning, the samples in the test point vicinity are considered to have higher impact on fitting the model. In this study, a quadratic cost function is considered for the regression problem. Localizing the objective function is done by considering a weighted quadratic cost function at which point the samples in the neighborhood of the test point have larger weights. We investigate two weighting schemes based on the cosine similarity between the training samples and the test point. In order to assess the performance of the proposed method in different weather conditions, the experiments are conducted on two different time periods of a year.

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a signiﬁcant margin. Using an ensemble of batchnormalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classiﬁcation: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

	abstract = {Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a widely adopted technique that enables faster and more stable training of deep neural networks (DNNs). Despite its pervasiveness, the exact reasons for BatchNorm's effectiveness are still poorly understood. The popular belief is that this effectiveness stems from controlling the change of the layers' input distributions during training to reduce the so-called "internal covariate shift". In this work, we demonstrate that such distributional stability of layer inputs has little to do with the success of BatchNorm. Instead, we uncover a more fundamental impact of BatchNorm on the training process: it makes the optimization landscape significantly smoother. This smoothness induces a more predictive and stable behavior of the gradients, allowing for faster training.},

	abstract = {Abstract Topological data analysis (TDA) is a tool from data science and mathematics that is beginning to make waves in environmental science. In this work, we seek to provide an intuitive and understandable introduction to a tool from TDA that is particularly useful for the analysis of imagery, namely, persistent homology. We briefly discuss the theoretical background but focus primarily on understanding the output of this tool and discussing what information it can glean. To this end, we frame our discussion around a guiding example of classifying satellite images from the sugar, fish, flower, and gravel dataset produced for the study of mesoscale organization of clouds by Rasp et al. We demonstrate how persistent homology and its vectorization, persistence landscapes, can be used in a workflow with a simple machine learning algorithm to obtain good results, and we explore in detail how we can explain this behavior in terms of image-level features. One of the core strengths of persistent homology is how interpretable it can be, so throughout this paper we discuss not just the patterns we find but why those results are to be expected given what we know about the theory of persistent homology. Our goal is that readers of this paper will leave with a better understanding of TDA and persistent homology, will be able to identify problems and datasets of their own for which persistent homology could be helpful, and will gain an understanding of the results they obtain from applying the included GitHub example code. Significance Statement Information such as the geometric structure and texture of image data can greatly support the inference of the physical state of an observed Earth system, for example, in remote sensing to determine whether wildfires are active or to identify local climate zones. Persistent homology is a branch of topological data analysis that allows one to extract such information in an interpretable way—unlike black-box methods like deep neural networks. The purpose of this paper is to explain in an intuitive manner what persistent homology is and how researchers in environmental science can use it to create interpretable models. We demonstrate the approach to identify certain cloud patterns from satellite imagery and find that the resulting model is indeed interpretable.},

	abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

	abstract = {In multivariate time series forecasting tasks, expanding forecast length and improving forecast efficiency is an urgent need for practical applications. Accurate long-term forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to the entangled temporal patterns of multivariate time series and the complex dependencies between variables at different periods. However, it is unreliable for most current models to capture temporal and inter-variable dependencies in intertwined temporal patterns. Furthermore, the Auto-Correlation mechanism cannot precisely capture the local dynamics and long-term dependencies of time series. To address these issues, we propose a concise and efficient model named SDCNet, which integrates time series decomposition and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) into a unified framework. Unlike previous approaches, SDCNet untangles the entangled temporal patterns and uses CNNs to capture the dependencies in both temporal and feature dimensions, respectively. Specifically, SDCNet progressively decomposes seasonal and trend-cyclical components from past time series, and uses temporal and feature convolution modules to extract seasonal patterns and inter-variable dependencies, respectively. Compared to competing methods, SDCNet achieves the best performance on all of four real-world datasets with a relative accuracy improvement of 16.73\%. In addition, SDCNet achieves a relative performance gain of 23.87\% on datasets with no significant periodicity.},

	abstract = {Generating forecasts for time series with multiple seasonal cycles is an important use-case for many industries nowadays. Accounting for the multi-seasonal patterns becomes necessary to generate more accurate and meaningful forecasts in these contexts. In this paper, we propose Long Short-Term Memory Multi-Seasonal Net (LSTM-MSNet), a decompositionbased, uniﬁed prediction framework to forecast time series with multiple seasonal patterns. The current state of the art in this space are typically univariate methods, in which the model parameters of each time series are estimated independently. Consequently, these models are unable to include key patterns and structures that may be shared by a collection of time series. In contrast, LSTM-MSNet is a globally trained Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), where a single prediction model is built across all the available time series to exploit the crossseries knowledge in a group of related time series. Furthermore, our methodology combines a series of state-of-the-art multiseasonal decomposition techniques to supplement the LSTM learning procedure. In our experiments, we are able to show that on datasets from disparate data sources, like e.g. the popular M4 forecasting competition, a decomposition step is beneﬁcial, whereas in the common real-world situation of homogeneous series from a single application, exogenous seasonal variables or no seasonal preprocessing at all are better choices. All options are readily included in the framework and allow us to achieve competitive results for both cases, outperforming many state-ofthe-art multi-seasonal forecasting methods.},

Aiming at the shortcomings of existing methods, in this paper we propose a new time series forecasting model LSTM-attention-LSTM. The model uses two LSTM models as the encoder and decoder, and introduces an attention mechanism between the encoder and decoder. The model has two distinctive features: first, by using the attention mechanism to calculate the interrelationship between sequence data, it overcomes the disadvantage of the coder-and-decoder model in that the decoder cannot obtain sufficiently long input sequences; second, it is suitable for sequence forecasting with long time steps. In this paper we validate the proposed model based on several real data sets, and the results show that the LSTM-attention-LSTM model is more accurate than some currently dominant models in prediction. The experiment also assessed the effect of the attention mechanism at different time steps by varying the time step.},

This paper offers an Adversarial Truncated Cauchy Self-Attentive Time-Variant Neural Network (ASATVN) for multi-step ahead time series forecasting. Specifically, the proposed model builds on Generative Adversarial Networks, in which the generator is composed of a novel time-variant model. The time-variant model contributes to learning dynamic time-series changes with its time-variant architecture and employs a newly proposed Truncated Cauchy Self-Attention block to capture the local sequential dependencies better. For the discriminator, two self-attentive discriminators are presented to regularize predictions with fidelity and continuity, which is beneficial to predicting sequence over longer time horizons.

	abstract = {Soil water-groundwater interactions are important in determining the moisture profile in a soil column. However, the Noah Land Surface Model (Noah LSM), the land surface component of several general circulation models, does not consider groundwater effects. The present study investigates the impact of integrating a groundwater model into the Noah LSM. By performing experiments forced by observations at the surface, insights into the characteristics of soil moisture evolution with and without the aquifer are investigated. In the absence of surface precipitation, soil moisture is shown to exhibit an exponential decay rate without the aquifer (termed as Noah-Cntl). This is because evapotranspiration dominates other processes governing the soil moisture evolution. Based on scale analysis, we derived an analytical equation that could well represent the aforementioned exponential variation in soil moisture. Presence of the aquifer (termed as Noah-GW) makes the capillary processes important as well. The result is a slower decay of soil moisture as compared to Noah-Cntl without surface precipitation. Soil moisture evolution in both the models is a function of vegetation and soil types. As a result, the aforementioned decay timescale displays significant heterogeneity over the Indian region, with Central India exhibiting relatively faster decay rates. We also performed 24-year long experiments with observed interannually varying forcing that indicates an enhancement in the annual mean soil moisture at all levels due to groundwater effects. This enhancement is particularly prominent during the post-monsoon season, reaffirming the results of the drain-out experiments mentioned above.},

For both VIIRS sensors we characterized residual linear calibration trends and cross-calibrated both sensors to MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua regarded as a calibration standard. The relative spectral response (RSR) differences were accounted for using the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) hyperspectral surface reflectance data. Our results agree with independent vicarious calibration results of both the MODIS/VIIRS Characterization Support Team as well as the CERES Imager and Geostationary Calibration Group within estimated uncertainty of 1–2\%. Analysis of MAIAC geophysical products with the new calibration shows a high level of agreement of MAIAC aerosol, surface reflectance and NDVI records between MODIS and VIIRS. Excluding high aerosol optical depth (AOD), all three sensors agree in AOD with mean difference (MD) less than 0.01 and residual mean squared difference rmsd ∼ 0.04. Spectral geometrically normalized surface reflectance agrees within rmsd of 0.003–0.005 in the visible and 0.01–0.012 at longer wavelengths. The residual surface reflectance differences are fully explained by differences in spectral filter functions. Finally, difference in NDVI is characterized by rmsd ∼ 0.02 and MD less than 0.003 for NDVI based on VIIRS imagery bands I1/I2 and less than 0.01 for NDVI based on VIIRS radiometric bands M5/M7. In practical sense, these numbers indicate consistency and continuity in MAIAC records ensuring the smooth transition from MODIS to VIIRS.},

To span the range between nonabsorbing and strongly absorbing particles, (NH4)2SO4 and soot aerosols are considered individually and in internal and external mixtures. For a cloud layer embedded within an aerosol layer it is shown that direct aerosol radiative forcing still occurs. For a nonabsorbing aerosol a maximum in (negative) forcing actually occurs for a thin cloud layer (100 m thickness for the set of parameters considered). The presence of an embedded cloud layer enhances the heating effect of soot aerosol, producing, for thick clouds, forcing values as much as a factor of 3 over those under cloud-free conditions. An absorbing aerosol layer can lead to an increase of in-cloud solar heating rates by up to 3\% for the parameter values considered here. A cirrus cloud layer above an aerosol layer leads to only modest changes of TOA aerosol forcing from those in the absence of the cloud layer; thus aerosol forcing in the presence of typical cirrus clouds cannot be neglected.},

We show that, in general, the climate response, specifically the global mean temperature change, is sensitive to the altitude, latitude, and nature of the forcing; that is, the response to a given forcing can vary by 50\% or more depending upon characteristics of the forcing other than its magnitude measured in watts per square meter. The consistency of the response among different forcings is higher, within 20\% or better, for most of the globally distributed forcings suspected of influencing global mean temperature in the past century, but exceptions occur for certain changes of ozone or absorbing aerosols, for which the climate response is less well behaved. In all cases the physical basis for the variations of the response can be understood. The principal mechanisms involve alterations of lapse rate and decrease (increase) of large-scale cloud cover in layers that are preferentially heated (cooled). Although the magnitude of these effects must be model-dependent, the existence and sense of the mechanisms appear to be reasonable. Overall, we reaffirm the value of the radiative forcing concept for predicting climate response and for comparative studies of different forcings; indeed, the present results can help improve the accuracy of such analyses and define error estimates. Our results also emphasize the need for measurements having the specificity and precision needed to define poorly known forcings such as absorbing aerosols and ozone change. Available data on aerosol single scatter albedo imply that anthropogenic aerosols cause less cooling than has commonly been assumed. However, negative forcing due to the net ozone change since 1979 appears to have counterbalanced 30–50\% of the positive forcing due to the increase of well-mixed greenhouse gases in the same period. As the net ozone change includes halogen-driven ozone depletion with negative radiative forcing and a tropospheric ozone increase with positive radiative forcing, it is possible that the halogen-driven ozone depletion has counterbalanced more than half of the radiative forcing due to well-mixed greenhouse gases since 1979.},

A detailed study is presented which shows that the cloud optical thickness (τc) and effective particle radius (re) of water clouds can be determined solely from reflection function measurements at 0.75 and 2.16 μm, provided τc ≳ 4 and re ≳ 6 μm. For optically thin clouds the retrieval becomes ambiguous, resulting in two possible solutions for the effective radius and optical thickness. Adding a third channel near 1.65 μm does not improve the situation noticeably, whereas the addition of a channel near 3.70 μm reduces the ambiguity in deriving the effective radius. The effective radius determined by the above procedure corresponds to the droplet radius at some optical depth within the cloud layer. For clouds having τc ≳ 8, the effective radius determined using the 0.75 and 2.16 μm channels can be regarded as 85\%–95\% of the radius at cloud top, which corresponds in turn to an optical depth 20\%–40\% of the total optical thickness of the cloud layer.},

Increased aerosol concentrations due to human activity affect droplet number concentration, liquid water and cloud fraction2, but these changes are subject to large uncertainties3. Ship tracks, long lines of polluted clouds that are visible in satellite images, are one of the main tools for quantifying aerosol–cloud interactions4. However, only a small fraction of the clouds polluted by shipping show ship tracks5,6. Here we show that even when no ship tracks are visible in satellite images, aerosol emissions change cloud properties substantially. We develop a new method to quantify the effect of shipping on all clouds, showing a cloud droplet number increase and a more positive liquid water response when there are no visible tracks. We directly detect shipping-induced cloud property changes in the trade cumulus regions of the Atlantic, which are known to display almost no visible tracks. Our results indicate that previous studies of ship tracks were suffering from selection biases by focusing only on visible tracks from satellite imagery. The strong liquid water path response we find translates to a larger aerosol cooling effect on the climate, potentially masking a higher climate sensitivity than observed temperature trends would otherwise suggest.},

	abstract = {Daily distribution of the aerosol optical thickness and columnar mass concentration will be derived over the continents, from the EOS moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) using dark land targets. Dark land covers are mainly vegetated areas and dark soils observed in the red and blue channels; therefore the method will be limited to the moist parts of the continents (excluding water and ice cover). After the launch of MODIS the distribution of elevated aerosol concentrations, for example, biomass burning in the tropics or urban industrial aerosol in the midlatitudes, will be continuously monitored. The algorithm takes advantage of the MODIS wide spectral range and high spatial resolution and the strong spectral dependence of the aerosol opacity for most aerosol types that result in low optical thickness in the mid-IR (2.1 and 3.8 μm). The main steps of the algorithm are (1) identification of dark pixels in the mid-IR; (2) estimation of their reflectance at 0.47 and 0.66 μm; and (3) derivation of the optical thickness and mass concentration of the accumulation mode from the detected radiance. To differentiate between dust and aerosol dominated by accumulation mode particles, for example, smoke or sulfates, ratios of the aerosol path radiance at 0.47 and 0.66 μm are used. New dynamic aerosol models for biomass burning aerosol, dust and aerosol from industrial/urban origin, are used to determine the aerosol optical properties used in the algorithm. The error in the retrieved aerosol optical thicknesses, τa is expected to be Δτa = 0.05±0.2τa. Daily values are stored on a resolution of 10×10 pixels (1 km nadir resolution). Weighted and gridded 8-day and monthly composites of the optical thickness, the aerosol mass concentration and spectral radiative forcing are generated for selected scattering angles to increase the accuracy. The daily aerosol information over land and oceans [Tanré et al., this issue], combined with continuous aerosol remote sensing from the ground, will be used to study aerosol climatology, to monitor the sources and sinks of specific aerosol types, and to study the interaction of aerosol with water vapor and clouds and their radiative forcing of climate. The aerosol information will also be used for atmospheric corrections of remotely sensed surface reflectance. In this paper, examples of applications and validations are provided.},

condensation nuclei, impact the hydrologic cycle, through changes in cloud cover, cloud properties and
precipitation. Unravelling these feedbacks is particularly difficult because aerosols take a multitude of shapes
and forms, ranging from desert dust to urban pollution, and because aerosol concentrations vary strongly
over time and space. To accurately study aerosol distribution and composition therefore requires continuous
observations from satellites, networks of ground-based instruments and dedicated field experiments.
Increases in aerosol concentration and changes in their composition, driven by industrialization and an
expanding population, may adversely affect the Earth’s climate and water supply.},

Even for the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) wide spectral range, only three parameters that describe the aerosol loading and size distribution can be retrieved. These three parameters are not always unique. For instance, the spectral radiance of an aerosol with a bilognormal size distribution can be simulated very well with a single lognormal aerosol with an appropriate mean radius and width of distribution. Preassumptions on the general structure of the size distribution are therefore required in the inversion of MODIS data. The retrieval of the aerosol properties is performed using lookup table computations. The volume size distribution in the lookup table is described with two lognormal modes: a single mode to describe the accumulation mode particles (radius {\textless}0.5 μm) and a single coarse mode to describe dust and/or salt particles (radius {\textgreater}1.0 μm). Note that two accumulation modes may be present, one dominated by gas phase processes and a second dominated by cloud phase processes. The coarse mode can also be split into several partially overlapping modes describing maritime salt particles and dust. The aerosol parameters we expect to retrieve are η, the fractional contribution of the accumulation mode to scattering; τ, the spectral optical thickness; and rm, the mean particle size of the dominant mode. Additional radiative quantities such as asymmetry parameter and effective radius are derived subsequently. The impact of the surface conditions, wind speed and chlorophyll content on the retrieval is estimated, the impact of potential sources of error like the calibration of the instrument is also tested. The algorithm has been applied successfully to actual data sets provided by the Thematic Mapper on Landsat 5 and by the MODIS airborne simulator on the ER-2 and tested against ground and airborne measurements. A first estimate of the general accuracy is Δτ = ±0.05±0.05τ (at 550 nm), Δrm = 0.3rm, Δη = ±0.25.},

At Uber, probabilistic time series forecasting is used for robust prediction of number of trips during special events, driver incentive allocation, as well as real-time anomaly detection across millions of metrics. Classical time series models are often used in conjunction with a probabilistic formulation for uncertainty estimation. However, such models are hard to tune, scale, and add exogenous variables to. Motivated by the recent resurgence of Long Short Term Memory networks, we propose a novel end-to-end Bayesian deep model that provides time series prediction along with uncertainty estimation. We provide detailed experiments of the proposed solution on completed trips data, and successfully apply it to large-scale time series anomaly detection at Uber.},

A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper investigates the important difference in the relationship between brightness temperatures between the 11-μm and the 12-μn AVHRR data and the microphysical properties of the semitransparent cirrus clouds. In the nonscattering approximation, the emittance for channels 4 and 5 are related through the absorption coefficient ratio that is the key parameter giving access to the size of cloud particles. The observed mean value of this parameter corresponds to effective radius of 18 μm for polydisperse spheres and 12 μm for polydisperse infinitely long ice cylinders. Taking the multiple scattering into account, the brightness temperature difference enhances much more for cylinders than for spheres owing to the fact that the forward peak of scattering is less large for cylinders. To obtain the size of cloud particles, the method developed in the nonscattering case is still applicable if one makes use of the effective emittance that implicitly includes the effects of mattering. Thus, an effective absorption coefficient ratio is defined and we derive a direct relationship between this ratio and the optical properties of the cloud particles. The mean value of the effective absorption coefficient ratio corresponds to ice spheres of effective radius of 26 μm or a bit less in the case of water spheres (supercooled droplets), but no agreement can be obtained for fully randomly oriented cylinders.},

	abstract = {Abstract Remote sensing instruments are heavily used to provide observations for both the operational and research communities. These sensors do not provide direct observations of the desired atmospheric variables, but instead, retrieval algorithms are necessary to convert the indirect observations into the variable of interest. It is critical to be aware of the underlying assumptions made by many retrieval algorithms, including that the retrieval problem is often ill posed and that there are various sources of uncertainty that need to be treated properly. In short, the retrieval challenge is to invert a set of noisy observations to obtain estimates of atmospheric quantities. The problem is often complicated by imperfect forward models, by imperfect prior knowledge, and by the existence of nonunique solutions. Optimal estimation (OE) is a widely used physical retrieval method that combines measurements, prior information, and the corresponding uncertainties based on Bayes’s theorem to find an optimal solution for the atmospheric state. Furthermore, OE also allows the relative contributions of the different sources of error to the uncertainty in the final retrieved atmospheric state to be understood. Here, we provide a novel Python library to illustrate the use of OE for inverse problems in the atmospheric sciences. We introduce two example problems: how to retrieve drop size distribution parameters from radar observations and how to retrieve the temperature profile from ground-based microwave sensors. Using these examples, we discuss common pitfalls, how the various error sources impact the retrieval, and how the quality of the retrieval results can be quantified.},

The criterion of asymptotic sufficiency which has been called "second order efficiency" is rejected as a criterion of goodness of estimate as against some loss function such as the mean squared error. The relation between MLE and sufficiency is not assured, as illustrated in an example in which MLE yields ∞ as estimate with samples that have different values of the sufficient statistic. Other examples are cited in which minimal sufficient statistics exist but where the MLE is not sufficient.

The computations were obtained by successive applications of the invariant imbedding, doubling and asymptotic fitting methods to cover the range from very thin to very thick atmospheres. Results are presented which illustrate the magnitude of the separate terms in the Fourier expansion of the phase function and the Fourier expansion of the reflection function of a semi-infinite atmosphere as a function of the zenith angles of incidence and reflection. The azimuthally independent reflection function is enhanced by as much as a factor of 115 over the first-order reflection function, whereas the azimuth-dependent reflection functions generally result from less multiple scattering. These results are compared with those for an atmosphere having a Henyey-Greenstein phase function with the same asymmetry factor (g = 0.84123) as in the cloud model. The relative difference in the escape function and azimuthally independent reflection function is generally less than a few per cent, though differences up to 70\% occur in the reflection function at angles where single scattering is important. Results are also presented which show the number of terms required in the Fourier expansion of the reflection function to be assured an accuracy of 0.1\%. The number of terms required depends strongly on the zenith angles of incidence and reflections as well as on details of the phase function.},

Uncertainty estimates for the retrievals are presented along with a discussion of the algorithm.

	abstract = {Abstract A method is presented for determining the single scattering albedo of clouds at selected wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared wavelength regions. The procedure compares measurements of the ratio of the zenith to nadir propagating intensifies deep within a cloud layer with radiative transfer computations of the same. Analytic formulas are derived which explicitly show the dependence of the internal intensity ratio on ground albedo, optical depth, single scattering albedo and cloud asymmetry factor. The single scattering albedo and cloud asymmetry factor enter the solution in such a way that a similarity relationship exists between these two parameters. As a result, the accuracy with which the single scattering albedo can be determined is dictated by the accuracy with which the asymmetry factor can be estimated. A method of observation is described whereby aircraft measurements of the zenith and nadir propagating intensifies can be used to determine the similarity parameter as a function of wavelength. Since the fractional absorption of a cloud depends on the similarity parameter and not on the single scattering albedo and asymmetry factor separately, this poses no severe limitation to the method. An accurate knowledge of the ground albedo and total optical thickness of a cloud are unnecessary for a solution, provided one associates the wavelength for which the intensity ratio is a maximum with conservative scattering. Under this internal calibration approach, uncertainties in the ground albedo are very nearly compensated by uncertainties in the cloud optical thickness.},

	abstract = {The approach of training sequence models using supervised learning and next-step prediction suffers from known failure modes. For example, it is notoriously difficult to ensure multi-step generated sequences have coherent global structure. We propose a novel sequence-learning approach in which we use a pre-trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to supply part of the reward value in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model. Thus, we can refine a sequence predictor by optimizing for some imposed reward functions, while maintaining good predictive properties learned from data. We propose efficient ways to solve this by augmenting deep Q-learning with a cross-entropy reward and deriving novel off-policy methods for RNNs from KL control. We explore the usefulness of our approach in the context of music generation. An LSTM is trained on a large corpus of songs to predict the next note in a musical sequence. This Note-RNN is then refined using our method and rules of music theory. We show that by combining maximum likelihood (ML) and RL in this way, we can not only produce more pleasing melodies, but significantly reduce unwanted behaviors and failure modes of the RNN, while maintaining information learned from data.},

The relative angular distribution of the intensity field at each wavelength is used to determine the similarity parameter, and hence single scattering albedo, of the cloud at that wavelength using the diffusion domain method. In addition to the spectral similarity parameter, the analysis provides a good estimate of the optical thickness of the cloud beneath the aircraft. Results of such analysis are presented for a 50 km section of clean marine stratocumulus clouds off the coast of California on 10 July 1987. These observations were obtained from the University of Washington Convair C-131A aircraft as part of the First ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) Regional Experiment (FIRE). In addition to the radiation measurements, we obtained microphysical and thermodynamic measurements from which the expected similarity parameter spectrum was calculated using accepted values of the refractive index of liquid water and the transmission function of water vapor. The measured absorption for this case of clean maritime clouds is close to, but persistently larger than, theoretical predictions. Finally, measurements are presented of the spectral albedo of the ocean surface under overcast conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract A method is presented for determining the scaled optical thickness of clouds from reflected solar radiation measurements. The procedure compares measurements of the reflection function with asymptotic expressions for the reflection function of optically thick layers. Analytic formulas are derived which explicitly show the dependence of the reflection and transmission functions of nonabsorbing atmospheres, on cloud optical thickness (τc), ground albedo (Ag) and asymmetry factor (g). For nonconservative atmospheres, the dependence of the reflection function on single scattering albedo (ω0) and asymmetry factor are contained implicitly in the asymptotic functions and constants. These asymptotic expressions for both conservative and nonconservative atmosphere are shown to be valid when the scaled optical thickness (1−g)τc≥??1.45, corresponding to clouds of optical thickness τc≥??9. By utilizing the asymptotic expression for the reflection function of an optically thick, conservatively scattering atmosphere. a simple expression is obtained relating the measured reflection function to scaled optical thickness. This expression shows that the ground albedo produces a constant bias in the derived optical thickness, regardless of the value of the measured reflection function. High-resolution images of the reflection function of clouds have been obtained with a multichannel scanning radiometer operated from a high-altitude aircraft. An image of the reflection function of clouds obtained from a stratiform cloud system in central Oklahoma is analyzed using two different phase functions. Results show that details of the single scattering phase function have an impact on the derived optical thickness, although the dominant influence is the cloud asymmetry factor which appears explicitly in the analysis.},

	abstract = {We present results that demonstrate the effects of Rayleigh scattering on the retrieval of cloud optical thickness at a visible wavelength (0.66 μm). The sensor-measured radiance at a visible wavelength (0.66 μm) is usually used to infer remotely the cloud optical thickness from aircraft or satellite instruments. For example, we find that without removing Rayleigh scattering effects, errors in the retrieved cloud optical thickness for a thin water cloud layer (τc=2.0) range from 15 to 60\%, depending on solar zenith angle and viewing geometry. For an optically thick cloud (τc≳10), on the other hand, errors can range from 10 to 60\% for large solar zenith angles (θ0≳60°) because of enhanced Rayleigh scattering. It is therefore particularly important to correct for Rayleigh scattering contributions to the reflected signal from a cloud layer both (1) for the case of thin clouds and (2) for large solar zenith angles and all clouds. On the basis of the single scattering approximation, we propose an iterative method for effectively removing Rayleigh scattering contributions from the measured radiance signal in cloud optical thickness retrievals. The proposed correction algorithm works very well and can easily be incorporated into any cloud retrieval algorithm. The Rayleigh correction method is applicable to cloud at any pressure, providing that the cloud top pressure is known to within ±100 hPa. With the Rayleigh correction the errors in retrieved cloud optical thickness are usually reduced to within 3\%. In cases of both thin cloud layers and thick clouds with large solar zenith angles, the errors are usually reduced by a factor of about 2 to over 10. The Rayleigh correction algorithm has been tested with simulations for realistic cloud optical and microphysical properties with different solar and viewing geometries. We apply the Rayleigh correction algorithm to the cloud optical thickness retrievals from experimental data obtained during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment (ASTEX) conducted near the Azores in June 1992 and compare these results to corresponding retrievals obtained using 0.88 μm. These results provide an example of the Rayleigh scattering effects on thin clouds and further test the Rayleigh correction scheme. Using a nonabsorbing near-infrared wavelength (0.88 μm) in retrieving cloud optical thickness is only applicable over oceans, however, since most land surfaces are highly reflective at 0.88 μm. Hence successful global retrievals of cloud optical thickness should remove Rayleigh scattering effects when using reflectance measurements at 0.66 μm.},

This paper presents the CPP algorithm and determines if SEVIRI can be used together with AVHRR to build a consistent and accurate data set of cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud liquid water path (CLWP) over Europe for climate research purposes. After quantifying the differences in 0.6 and 1.6 μm operational calibrated reflectances of SEVIRI and AVHRR, a recalibration procedure is proposed to normalize and absolutely calibrate these reflectances. The effects of recalibration, spatial resolution, and viewing geometry differences on the SEVIRI and AVHRR cloud property retrievals are evaluated. The intercomparison of 0.6 and 1.6 μm operationally calibrated reflectances indicates ∼6 and ∼26\% higher reflectances for SEVIRI than for AVHRR. These discrepancies result in retrieval differences between AVHRR and SEVIRI of ∼8\% for COT and ∼60\% for CLWP. Owing to recalibration these differences reduce to ∼5\%, while the magnitude of the median COT and CLWP values of AVHRR decrease ∼2 and ∼60\% and the SEVIRI values increase ∼10 and ∼55\%, respectively. The differences in spatial resolution and viewing geometry slightly influence the retrieval precision. Thus the CPP algorithm can be used to build a consistent and high-quality data set of SEVIRI and AVHRR retrieved cloud properties for climate research purposes, provided the instrument reflectances are recalibrated, preferably guided by the satellite operators.},

It employs the simple relationships found by Slingo and Schrecker for the optical depth, single scatter albedo and asymmetry parameter of cloud drops as function of the cloud liquid water path and equivalent radius of the drop size distribution. The cloud radiative properties are then obtained from standard two-stream equations for a homogeneous layer. The effect of water vapor absorption within the cloud is ignored in this version, leading to a small underestimate of the cloud absorption. The parameterization is compared with other schemes and with aircraft observations. It performs satisfactorily even when only four spectral bands are employed. The explicit separation of the dependence of the derived cloud radiative properties on the liquid water path and equivalent radius is new, and should prove valuable for climate change investigations.},

Specifically, we utilize the pullback metric to find the local latent basis in \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{X\}\$ and their corresponding local tangent basis in \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{H\}\$, the intermediate feature maps of DMs. The discovered latent basis enables unsupervised image editing capability through latent space traversal. We investigate the discovered structure from two perspectives. First, we examine how geometric structure evolves over diffusion timesteps. Through analysis, we show that 1) the model focuses on low-frequency components early in the generative process and attunes to high-frequency details later; 2) At early timesteps, different samples share similar tangent spaces; and 3) The simpler datasets that DMs trained on, the more consistent the tangent space for each timestep. Second, we investigate how the geometric structure changes based on text conditioning in Stable Diffusion. The results show that 1) similar prompts yield comparable tangent spaces; and 2) the model depends less on text conditions in later timesteps. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to present image editing through \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}\$-space traversal and provide thorough analyses of the latent structure of DMs.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the many developments in estimates of the direct and indirect global annual mean radiative forcing due to present-day concentrations of anthropogenic tropospheric aerosols since Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [1996]. The range of estimates of the global mean direct radiative forcing due to six distinct aerosol types is presented. Additionally, the indirect effect is split into two components corresponding to the radiative forcing due to modification of the radiative properties of clouds (cloud albedo effect) and the effects of anthropogenic aerosols upon the lifetime of clouds (cloud lifetime effect). The radiative forcing for anthropogenic sulphate aerosol ranges from −0.26 to −0.82 W m−2. For fossil fuel black carbon the radiative forcing ranges from +0.16 W m−2 for an external mixture to +0.42 W m−2 for where the black carbon is modeled as internally mixed with sulphate aerosol. For fossil fuel organic carbon the two estimates of the likely weakest limit of the direct radiative forcing are −0.02 and −0.04 W m−2. For biomass-burning sources of black carbon and organic carbon the combined radiative forcing ranges from −0.14 to −0.74 W m−2. Estimates of the radiative forcing due to mineral dust vary widely from +0.09 to −0.46 W m−2; even the sign of the radiative forcing is not well established due to the competing effects of solar and terrestrial radiative forcings. A single study provides a very tentative estimate of the radiative forcing of nitrates to be −0.03 W m−2. Estimates of the cloud albedo indirect radiative forcing range from −0.3 to approximately −1.8 W m−2. Although the cloud lifetime effect is identified as a potentially important climate forcing mechanism, it is difficult to quantify in the context of the present definition of radiative forcing of climate change and current model simulations. This is because its estimation by general circulation models necessarily includes some level of cloud and water vapor feedbacks, which affect the hydrological cycle and the dynamics of the atmosphere. Available models predict that the radiative flux perturbation associated with the cloud lifetime effect is of a magnitude similar to that of the cloud albedo effect.},

DESIS measures in the spectral range from 400 and 1000 nm with a spectral sampling distance of 2.55 nm and a Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of about 3.5 nm. The ground sample distance is 30 m with 1024 pixels across track. In this article, a detailed review is given on the applicability of DESIS data based on the specifics of the instrument, the characteristics of the ISS orbit, and the methods applied to generate products. The various DESIS data products available for users are described with the focus on specific processing steps. The results of the data quality and product validation studies show that top-of-atmosphere radiance, geometrically corrected, and bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance products meet the mission requirements. The limitations of the DESIS data products are also subject to a critical examination.},

	abstract = {The automatic correction of atmospheric effects currently requires visible to short‐wave spectral bands (400–2500 nm) to derive high accuracy surface reflectance data. Common techniques employ spectral correlations of dark targets in the short‐wave infrared (SWIR, around 2.2 µm), blue (480 nm) and red (660 nm) regions to derive the aerosol optical depth. A large number of current Earth‐observing satellite sensors have only three or four spectral channels in the visible and near‐infrared (VNIR) region (400–1000 nm), making an automatic image‐based atmospheric correction very difficult. This contribution presents a new algorithm and first results with VNIR imagery. The method starts with the assumption of average clear atmospheric conditions (aerosol optical depth AOD = 0.27, corresponding to a visibility of 23 km) and calculates the surface reflectance in the red and near‐infrared (NIR) bands. The second step derives a mask of dark vegetation pixels. It is calculated using multiple thresholds of vegetation index combined with red and NIR surface reflectance values. Then the red band surface reflectance for the dark pixels is estimated from the NIR reflectance as ρred = 0.1 ρnir, from which the aerosol optical depth (or visibility) can be calculated. The core of the VNIR algorithm consists of two subsequent iteration loops (visibility and ρred) to improve the visibility estimate. Results of the VNIR method are presented for Landsat‐5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat‐7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery using only the first four bands. The performance of the method is compared to the established dark pixel technique where the SWIR bands are included. Results show that the deviation between both methods is usually less than 0.005 reflectance units if measured in terms of the scene‐average reflectance, indicating a useful potential for this approach.},

The effect of urban aerosol is significant in the PAR part of solar spectrum, where attenuation of global PAR irradiance surpasses 18\% on very polluted atmospheric conditions. The increase in diffuse PAR irradiance caused by urban aerosol ranges in the interval 7\%–51\%. The ratio of global PAR to total global irradiance was found to depend slightly on air pollution whereas ratio's dependencies on site elevation were not identified clearly. Nevertheless, this ratio was found to be in good agreement with those reported in the literature. The ratio of diffuse-to-global PAR irradiance was found to depend on both, air mass and turbidity. For very turbid atmosphere and large air masses the 40\% of PAR irradiance results from diffuse radiation. Finally, some biological implications of the results are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {A cloud masking algorithm based on the spatial variability of reflectances at the top of the atmosphere in visible wavelengths was developed for the retrieval of aerosol properties by MODIS. It is shown that the spatial pattern of cloud reflectance as observed from space, is very different from that of aerosols. Clouds show a very high spatial variability in the scale of hundred meters to few kilometers, whereas aerosols in general are very homogeneous. The concept of spatial variability of reflectances at the top of the atmosphere is mainly applicable over the ocean where the surface background is sufficiently homogeneous for the separation between aerosols and clouds. Aerosol retrievals require a particular cloud masking approach since a conservative mask will screen out strong aerosol episodes and a less conservative mask could allow for cloud contamination that tremendously affect the retrieved aerosol optical properties (e.g. aerosol optical depth and effective radii). A detailed study on the effect of cloud contamination on aerosol retrievals is performed and parameters are established determining the threshold value for the MODIS aerosol cloud mask (3X3-STD) over the ocean. The 3X3-STD algorithm discussed in this paper is the operational cloud mask used for MODIS aerosol retrievals over the ocean.},

	abstract = {We describe a new VNIR-SWIR atmospheric correction method for multi- and hyperspectral imagery, dubbed QUAC (QUick Atmospheric Correction) that also enables retrieval of the wavelength-dependent optical depth of the aerosol or haze and molecular absorbers. It determines the atmospheric compensation parameters directly from the information contained within the scene using the observed pixel spectra. The approach is based on the empirical finding that the spectral standard deviation of a collection of diverse material spectra, such as the endmember spectra in a scene, is essentially spectrally flat. It allows the retrieval of reasonably accurate reflectance spectra even when the sensor does not have a proper radiometric or wavelength calibration, or when the solar illumination intensity is unknown. The computational speed of the atmospheric correction method is significantly faster than for the first-principles methods, making it potentially suitable for realtime applications. The aerosol optical depth retrieval method, unlike most prior methods, does not require the presence of dark pixels. In this paper, QUAC is applied to atmospherically correction several AVIRIS data sets. Comparisons to the physics-based FLAASH code are also presented.},

	abstract = {The detection of dark, dense vegetation is an important step in the remote sensing of aerosol loading. Current methods that employ the red (0.64 /spl mu/m) and the near-IR (0.84 /spl mu/m) regions are unsatisfactory in that the presence of aerosols in the scene distorts the apparent reflectance in the visible and near-IR ranges of the spectrum. The mid-IR spectral region is also sensitive to vegetation due to the absorption of liquid water in the foliage, but is not sensitive to the presence of most aerosols (except for dust). Therefore, mid-IR channels on the AVHRR and EOS-MODIS (e.g., the 3.75 /spl mu/m or the 3.95 /spl mu/m channels) have a unique potential for the remote sensing of dark, dense vegetation, particularly in the presence of biomass burning smoke or industrial/urban haze. The reflective part of the 3.75 /spl mu/m channel (/spl rho//sub 3.75/) is applied to images of the AVHRR over the eastern United States. This channel was found to be correlated to reflectance at 0.64 /spl mu/m (/spl rho//sub 0.64/), less sensitive to haze than the visible channel and superior to both the 0.64 /spl mu/m reflectance and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to determine forest pixels in an image. However, its application to monitor the seasonal evolution of vegetation is presently questionable. For the purpose of the remote sensing of aerosol over dark, dense vegetation, it is proposed that the dark, dense vegetation be determined from /spl rho//sub 3.75/{\textless}0.025. These findings may have further implications for other specific applications of the remote sensing of vegetation in hazy atmospheres.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

These measurements are used to derive spectral aerosol optical thickness and aerosol size parameters over both land and ocean. The aerosol products available over land include aerosol optical thickness at three visible wavelengths, a measure of the fraction of aerosol optical thickness attributed to the fine mode, and several derived parameters including reflected spectral solar flux at the top of the atmosphere. Over the ocean, the aerosol optical thickness is provided in seven wavelengths from 0.47 to 2.13 μm. In addition, quantitative aerosol size information includes effective radius of the aerosol and quantitative fraction of optical thickness attributed to the fine mode. Spectral irradiance contributed by the aerosol, mass concentration, and number of cloud condensation nuclei round out the list of available aerosol products over the ocean. The spectral optical thickness and effective radius of the aerosol over the ocean are validated by comparison with two years of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data gleaned from 132 AERONET stations. Eight thousand MODIS aerosol retrievals collocated with AERONET measurements confirm that one standard deviation of MODIS optical thickness retrievals fall within the predicted uncertainty of Δτ = ±0.03 ±0.05τ over ocean and Δτ = ±0.05 ± 0.15τ over land. Two hundred and seventy-one MODIS aerosol retrievals collocated with AERONET inversions at island and coastal sites suggest that one standard deviation of MODIS effective radius retrievals falls within Δreff = ±0.11 μm. The accuracy of the MODIS retrievals suggests that the product can be used to help narrow the uncertainties associated with aerosol radiative forcing of global climate.},

MODIS, a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, will be launched in 1999 aboard the first EOS (Earth Observing System). Following the MODIS procedure [Tanré et al, 1997], the spectral radiance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) measured over the ocean in a wide spectral range (0.55–2.13 μm) is used to derive the aerosol optical thickness (proportional to the aerosol total loading) and the aerosol size distribution (integrated over the vertical column) of the ambient (undisturbed) aerosol by comparing measured radiances with values in look-up table (LUT). The LUT includes the gas-phase oxidation accumulation mode, cloud-phase accumulation mode, and a coarse mode that represents maritime particles (salt) and dust. In each inversion, one accumulation and one coarse mode can be retrieved. The inversion retrieves the ratio of the contribution to the optical thicknesses of the two particle modes and the mean particle size that best fits the measurements. This algorithm is successfully applied to the data sets acquired during TARFOX. The MODIS airborne simulator (MAS) aboard the NASA ER-2 aircraft flew several times during the experiment above the University of Washington C-131A research aircraft on which the six-channel Ames Airborne Tracking Sun Photometer (AATS-6) was mounted. It flew also above surface-based Sun photometers. Optical thicknesses (at λ = 550 nm) as well as the spectral dependence from the various data sets compare very well.},

	abstract = {An atmospheric correction algorithm for high spatial resolution satellite sensors like Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) has been developed. The algorithm works with a catalogue of atmospheric correction functions stored in look-up tables. The catalogue consists of a broad range of atmospheric conditions (different altitude profiles of pressure, air temperature, and humidity; several aerosol types; ground elevations from 0-1 km above sea level; solar zenith angles ranging from 0°-70°). The catalogue covers visibilities (surface meteorological range) from 5-40 km, values can be extrapolated down to 4 km and up to 80km. The 1994 edition of the catalogue was compiled using the MODTRAN-2 and the SENSAT-5 codes. The algorithm consists of an interactive and an automatic part. The interactive phase serves for the definition of a reference target (dense dark vegetation or water) as well as haze and cloud. The reflectance of the reference target in a single spectral band (dark vegetation: TM band 3; water: TM band 4) has to be specified. Additionally, the image can be partitioned into sub-images, called sectors. This phase also selects one of the atmospheres available in the catalogue, i.e. the altitude profile of pressure, temperature and humidity as well as the aerosol type (e.g. rural) are fixed. The automatic phase first calculates the visibility of the reference areas for the selected atmosphere. The visibility is obtained by matching the measured signal (i.e the digital number (DN) converted to a radiance using the sensor calibration) to the model-derived signal in the spectral channel of known target reflectance. The sector-average visibility of the reference pixels is assigned to the non-reference pixels. The second step is the haze removal performed by histogram matching the statistics of the haze regions to the statistics of the clear part of the scene for each sector and each channel. The last step is the calculation of the ground reflectance image including the adjacency correction, and the computation of the ground brightness temperature image (TM band 6)},

geometric accuracies of some meters up to several hundred meters depending on the satellite mission, there is still a need to improve the geometric accuracy by using GCP. The manual measurement of GCP is time consuming work, and leads, especially for larger data sets with hundreds of satellite
images, to a cost and time ineffective workload. To overcome these shortcomings, an autonomous processing chain to georeference and orthorectify optical satellite data is proposed which uses reference data and digital elevation models to generate GCP and to improve sensor model parameters
(namely for rigorous and universal sensor models) for a series of optical Earth observation satellite systems. Using a restrictive blunder removal strategy, the proposed procedure leads to high quality orthorectified products or at least to a geometrically consistent data set in terms of relative
accuracy. The geometric processing chain is validated using SPOT-4 HRVIR, SPOT-5 HRG, IRS-P6 LISS III, and ALOS AVNIR-2 optical sensor data, for which a huge amount of satellite data ({\textasciitilde}3,200 scenes) has been processed. Relative and absolute geometric accuracies of approximately half

	abstract = {Traditional linear subspace reduced order models (LS-ROMs) are able to accelerate physical simulations in which the intrinsic solution space falls into a subspace with a small dimension, i.e., the solution space has a small Kolmogorov n-width. However, for physical phenomena not of this type, e.g., any advection-dominated flow phenomena such as in traffic flow, atmospheric flows, and air flow over vehicles, a low-dimensional linear subspace poorly approximates the solution. To address cases such as these, we have developed a fast and accurate physics-informed neural network ROM, namely nonlinear manifold ROM (NM-ROM), which can better approximate high-fidelity model solutions with a smaller latent space dimension than the LS-ROMs. Our method takes advantage of the existing numerical methods that are used to solve the corresponding full order models. The efficiency is achieved by developing a hyper-reduction technique in the context of the NM-ROM. Numerical results show that neural networks can learn a more efficient latent space representation on advection-dominated data from 1D and 2D Burgers' equations. A speedup of up to 2.6 for 1D Burgers' and a speedup of 11.7 for 2D Burgers' equations are achieved with an appropriate treatment of the nonlinear terms through a hyper-reduction technique. Finally, a posteriori error bounds for the NM-ROMs are derived that take account of the hyper-reduced operators.},

The goal is to emulate the RRTM accurately in a small fraction of the computing time, creating a U-net++ that could be used as a parameterization in numerical weather prediction (NWP). Target variables are surface downwelling flux, top-of-atmosphere upwelling flux ( FupTOA), net flux, and a profile of radiative-heating rates. We have devised several ways to make the U-net++ models knowledge-guided, recently identified as a key priority in machine learning (ML) applications to the geosciences. We conduct two experiments to find the best U-net++ configurations. In experiment 1, we train on nontropical sites and test on tropical sites, to assess extreme spatial generalization. In experiment 2, we train on sites from all regions and test on different sites from all regions, with the goal of creating the best possible model for use in NWP. The selected model from experiment 1 shows impressive skill on the tropical testing sites, except four notable deficiencies: large bias and error for heating rate in the upper stratosphere, unreliable FupTOA for profiles with single-layer liquid cloud, large heating-rate bias in the midtroposphere for profiles with multilayer liquid cloud, and negative bias at low zenith angles for all flux components and tropospheric heating rates. The selected model from experiment 2 corrects all but the first deficiency, and both models run {\textasciitilde}104 times faster than the RRTM. Our code is available publicly.},

	abstract = {The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes are critical components to advancing our understanding of the Earth's radiative energy balance, radiative effects of clouds and aerosols, and climate feedback. The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments provide broadband shortwave and longwave radiance measurements. These radiances are converted to fluxes by using scene-type-dependent angular distribution models (ADMs). This paper describes the next-generation ADMs that are developed for Terra and Aqua using all available CERES rotating azimuth plane radiance measurements. Coincident cloud and aerosol retrievals, and radiance measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and meteorological parameters from Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) data assimilation version 5.4.1 are used to define scene type. CERES radiance measurements are stratified by scene type and by other parameters that are important for determining the anisotropy of the given scene type. Anisotropic factors are then defined either for discrete intervals of relevant parameters or as a continuous functions of combined parameters, depending on the scene type. Significant differences between the ADMs described in this paper and the existing ADMs are over clear-sky scene types and polar scene types. Over clear ocean, we developed a set of shortwave (SW) ADMs that explicitly account for aerosols. Over clear land, the SW ADMs are developed for every 1° latitude × 1° longitude region for every calendar month using a kernel-based bidirectional reflectance model. Over clear Antarctic scenes, SW ADMs are developed by accounting the effects of sastrugi on anisotropy. Over sea ice, a sea-ice brightness index is used to classify the scene type. Under cloudy conditions over all surface types, the longwave (LW) and window (WN) ADMs are developed by combining surface and cloud-top temperature, surface and cloud emissivity, cloud fraction, and precipitable water. Compared to the existing ADMs, the new ADMs change the monthly mean instantaneous fluxes by up to 5 W m−2 on a regional scale of 1° latitude × 1° longitude, but the flux changes are less than 0.5 W m−2 on a global scale.},

New calibrations for solar channels and the use of the 1.24-μm channel for cloud optical depth (COD) over snow improve the daytime consistency between Terra and Aqua MODIS retrievals. Use of additional spectral channels and revised logic enhanced the cloud-top phase retrieval accuracy. A new ice crystal reflectance model and a CO2-channel algorithm retrieved higher ice clouds, while a new regional lapse rate technique produced more accurate water cloud heights than in Ed2. Ice cloud base heights are more accurate due to a new cloud thickness parameterization. Overall, CODs increased, especially over the polar (PO) regions. The mean particle sizes increased slightly for water clouds, but more so for ice clouds in the PO areas. New experimental parameters introduced in Ed4 are limited in utility, but will be revised for the next CERES edition. As part of the Ed4 retrieval evaluation, the average properties are compared with those from other algorithms and the differences between individual reference data and matched Ed4 retrievals are explored. Part II of this article provides a comprehensive, objective evaluation of selected parameters. More accurate interpretation of the CERES radiation measurements has resulted from the use of the Ed4 cloud properties.},

As the objective is to create a long-term climate data record, it is necessary to periodically reprocess the data in order to incorporate the latest calibration changes and algorithm improvements. Here, we focus on the improvements and validation of CERES Terra and Aqua radiances in Edition 4, which are used to generate higher-level climate data products. Onboard sources indicate that the total (TOT) channel response to longwave (LW) radiation has increased relative to the start of the missions by 0.4\% to 1\%. In the shortwave (SW), the sensor response change ranges from −0.4\% to 0.6\%. To account for in-orbit changes in SW spectral response function (SRF), direct nadir radiance comparisons between instrument pairs on the same satellite are made and an improved wavelength dependent degradation model is used to adjust the SRF of the instrument operating in a rotating azimuth plane scan mode. After applying SRF corrections independently to CERES Terra and Aqua, monthly variations amongst these instruments are highly correlated and the standard deviation in the difference of monthly anomalies is 0.2 Wm−2 for ocean and 0.3 Wm−2 for land/desert. Additionally, trends in CERES Terra and Aqua monthly anomalies are consistent to 0.21 Wm−2 per decade for ocean and 0.31 Wm−2 per decade for land/desert. In the LW, adjustments to the TOT channel SRF are made to ensure that removal of the contribution from the SW portion of the TOT channel with SW channel radiance measurements during daytime is consistent throughout the mission. Accordingly, anomalies in day–night LW difference in Edition 4 are more consistent compared to Edition 3, particularly for the Aqua land/desert case.},

	abstract = {Abstract Satellite observations from Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) radiometers have produced over two decades of world-class data documenting time–space variations in Earth’s top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation budget. In addition to energy exchanges among Earth and space, climate studies require accurate information on radiant energy exchanges at the surface and within the atmosphere. The CERES Cloud Radiative Swath (CRS) data product extends the standard Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) data product by calculating a suite of radiative fluxes from the surface to TOA at the instantaneous CERES footprint scale using the NASA Langley Fu–Liou radiative transfer model. Here, we describe the CRS flux algorithm and evaluate its performance against a network of ground-based measurements and CERES TOA observations. CRS all-sky downwelling broadband fluxes show significant improvements in surface validation statistics relative to the parameterized fluxes on the SSF product, including a ∼30\%–40\% (∼20\%) reduction in SW↓ (LW↓) root-mean-square error (RMSΔ), improved correlation coefficients, and the lowest SW↓ bias over most surface types. RMSΔ and correlation statistics improve over five different surface types under both overcast and clear-sky conditions. The global mean computed TOA outgoing LW radiation (OLR) remains within {\textless}1\% (2–3 W m−2) of CERES observations, while the global mean reflected SW radiation (RSW) is excessive by ∼3.5\% (∼9 W m−2) owing to cloudy-sky computation errors. As we highlight using data from two remote field campaigns, the CRS data product provides many benefits for studies requiring advanced surface radiative fluxes.},

The study also quantifies the radiative forcing of aerosols and that of clouds. The observational input to MACR includes data from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) for aerosol optical depths, single scattering albedos, and asymmetry factors; satellite retrieved column water vapor amount; the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) total ozone amount; and cloud fraction and cloud optical depth from the Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) cloud data. The present radiation budget estimates account for the diurnal variation in cloud properties. The model was validated against instantaneous, daily and monthly solar fluxes from the ground-based Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) network, the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) surface solar flux data, and CERES TOA measurements. The agreement between simulated and observed values are within experimental errors, for all of the cases considered here: instantaneous fluxes and monthly mean fluxes at stations around the world and TOA fluxes and cloud forcing for global annual mean and zonal mean fluxes; in addition the estimated aerosol forcing at TOA also agrees with other observationally derived estimates. Overall, such agreements suggest that global data sets of aerosols and cloud parameters released by recent satellite experiments (MISR, MODIS and CERES) meet the required accuracy to use them as input to simulate the radiative fluxes within instrumental errors. Last, the atmospheric solar absorption derived in this study should be treated as an improved estimate when compared with earlier published studies. The main source of improvement in the present estimate is the use of global distribution of observed parameters for model input such as aerosols and clouds. The agreement between simulated and observed solar fluxes at the surface supports our conclusion that the present estimate is an improvement over previous studies. MACR with the global input data was used to simulate the global and regional solar radiation budget, aerosol radiative forcing and cloud radiative forcing for a 3-year period from 2000 to 2002. We estimate the planetary albedo for a 3-year average to be 28.9 ± 1.2\% to be compared with CERES estimate of 28.6\% and ERBE's estimate of 29.6\%. Without clouds (including aerosols) the planetary albedo is only 15.0 ± 0.6\%. The global mean TOA shortwave cloud forcing is −47.5 ± 4 W m−2, comparing well with the CERES and ERBE estimates of −46.5 and −48 W m−2, respectively. The clear-sky atmospheric absorption is 72 ± 3 W m−2, and the surface absorption is 218 ± 4 W m−2. Clouds in all-sky conditions enhance atmospheric absorption from 72 ± 3 W m−2 to 79 ± 5 W m−2 and decrease surface solar absorption from 218 ± 4 W m−2 to 164 ± 6 W m−2. The present estimate of 79 W m−2 for all-sky solar absorption is much larger than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2001) values of about 67 W m−2. Most of the increased atmospheric solar absorption is due to improved treatment of aerosol absorption (backed by surface based aerosol network and chemical transport models) and water vapor spectroscopic data. The global mean clear-sky aerosol (both natural and anthropogenic) radiative forcing at the TOA and the surface are −6.0 ± 1 W m−2 and −11.0 ± 2 W m−2, respectively. In the presence of clouds the aerosol radiative forcing is −3.0 ± 1 W m−2 (at TOA) and −7.0 ± 2 W m−2 (at the surface). The study also documents the significant regional variations in the solar radiation budget and radiative forcing of aerosols and clouds.},

	abstract = {In 2019, an unusually strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole spawned hot and dry weather in southeastern Australia, which promoted devastating wildfires in the period from September 2019 to February 2020. The fires produced large plumes of biomass burning aerosols that prevented sunlight from reaching the Earth’s surface, and in this way elicited regional radiative cooling. We estimated the direct aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) resulting from these wildfires, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer space-based data and an empirical relationship from AErosol RObotic NETwork ground-based data collected in biomass-burning regions. The wildfire-derived air pollution was associated with an aerosol optical thickness of {\textgreater}0.3 in Victoria and a strongly negative ARF of between −14.8 and −17.7 W m−2, which decreased the surface air temperature by about 3.7 °C–4.4 °C. This is of the same order of magnitude as the radiative cooling from volcanic eruptions. Although the atmospheric lifetime of biomass-burning aerosols is relatively short (about a week), the Australian wildfire pollution plumes extended across the Pacific Ocean to South America. Since climate change is expected to lead to more frequent and increasingly intense fires in many regions worldwide, the consequent biomass burning aerosols may become a significant radiative forcing factor, which will need to be accounted for in climate model projections for the future.},

Recent development of weather-resistant automatic sun and sky scanning spectral radiometers enable frequent measurements of atmospheric aerosol optical properties and precipitable water at remote sites. Transmission of automatic measurements via the geostationary satellites GOES and METEOSATS’ Data Collection Systems allows reception and processing in near real-time from approximately 75\% of the Earth’s surface and with the expected addition of GMS, the coverage will increase to 90\% in 1998. NASA developed a UNIX-based near real-time processing, display and analysis system providing internet access to the emerging global database. Information on the system is available on the project homepage, http://spamer.gsfc.nasa.gov. The philosophy of an open access database, centralized processing and a user-friendly graphical interface has contributed to the growth of international cooperation for ground-based aerosol monitoring and imposes a standardization for these measurements. The system’s automatic data acquisition, transmission, and processing facilitates aerosol characterization on local, regional, and global scales with applications to transport and radiation budget studies, radiative transfer-modeling and validation of satellite aerosol retrievals. This article discusses the operation and philosophy of the monitoring system, the precision and accuracy of the measuring radiometers, a brief description of the processing system, and access to the database.},

Estimates of the dust optical depth were made from observations of the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Model calculations of the radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere were compared with ERBE measurements made during a dust outbreak that occurred over the Saudi Arabian peninsula during July 1985. Measurements of the ERBE over the oceanic regions indicated that the presence of the dust increased the clear-sky shortwave radiative exitance (SWRE) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) by 40–90 W m−2. Over the desert regions the differences in the SWRE between clear and dust-laden regions were difficult to determine from the satellite observations. In contrast, the presence of dust over the ocean decreased the observed longwave radiative exitance (LWRE) at the TOA by 5–20 W m−2, while over the desert regions its reduction was 20–50 W m−2. The major discrepancy between the observations and calculations occurred for the SWRE over the desert.},

A description is provided of the source of each component to this budget. The top-of-atmosphere shortwave and longwave flux of energy is constrained by satellite observations. Partitioning of the radiative energy throughout the atmosphere is achieved through the use of detailed radiation models for both the longwave and shortwave spectral regions. Spectral features of shortwave and longwave fluxes at both the top and surface of the earth's system are presented. The longwave radiative forcing of the climate system for both clear (125 W m−2) and cloudy (155 W m−2) conditions are discussed. The authors find that for the clear sky case the contribution due to water vapor to the total longwave radiative forcing is 75 W m−2, while for carbon dioxide it is 32 W m−2. Clouds alter these values, and the effects of clouds on both the longwave and shortwave budget are addressed. In particular, the shielding effect by clouds on absorption and emission by water vapor is as large as the direct cloud forcing. Because the net surface heat budget must balance, the radiative fluxes constrain the sum of the sensible and latent heat fluxes, which can also be estimated independently.},

Methods used to analyze data from previous radiation budget experiments are reviewed, and the rationale for the present algorithms is developed. The scanner data are converted to radiances by use of spectral factors, which account for imperfect spectral response of the optics. These radiances are converted to radiant exitances at the reference level by use of directional models, which account for anisotropy of the radiation as it leaves the earth. The spectral factors and directional models are selected on the basis of the scene, which is identified on the basis of the location and the long-wave and shortwave radiances. These individual results are averaged over 2.5° × 2.5° regions. Data from the wide and medium field-of-view instruments are analyzed by use of the traditional shape factor method and also by use of a numerical filter, which permits resolution enhancement along the orbit track.},

	abstract = {Abstract A method is proposed to compute the net solar (shortwave) irradiance at the earth's surface from Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) data in the S4 format. The S4 data are monthly averaged broadband planetary albedo collected at selected times during the day. Net surface shortwave irradiance is obtained from the shortwave irradiance incident at the top of the atmosphere (known) by subtracting both the shortwave energy flux reflected by the earth-atmosphere system (measured) and the energy flux absorbed by the atmosphere (modeled). Precalculated atmospheric- and surface-dependent functions that characterize scattering and absorption in the atmosphere are used, which makes the method easily applicable and computationally efficient. Four surface types are distinguished, namely, ocean, vegetation, desert, and snow/ice. Over the tropical Pacific Ocean, the estimates based on ERBE data compare well with those obtained from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) B3 data. For the 9 months analyzed the linear correlation coefficient and the standard difference between the two datasets are 0.95 and 14 W m−2 (about 6\% of the average shortwave irradiance), respectively, and the bias is 15 W m−2 (higher ERBE values). The bias, a strong function of ISCCP satellite viewing zenith angle, is mostly in the ISCCP-based estimates. Over snow/ice, vegetation, and desert no comparison is made with other satellite-based estimates, but theoretical calculations using the discrete ordinate method suggest that over highly reflective surfaces (snow/ice, desert) the model, which accounts crudely for multiple reflection between the surface and clouds, may substantially overestimate the absorbed solar energy flux at the surface, especially when clouds are optically thick. The monthly surface shortwave irradiance fields produced for 1986 exhibit the main features characteristic of the earth's climate. As found in other studies, our values are generally higher than Esbensen and Kushnir's by as much as 80 W m−2 in the tropical oceans. A cloud parameter, defined as the difference between clear-sky and actual irradiances normalized to top-of-atmosphere clear-sky irradiance, is also examined. This parameter, minimally affected by sun zenith angle, is higher in the midlatitude regions of storm tracks than in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), suggesting that, on average, the higher cloud coverage in midlatitudes is more effective at reducing surface shortwave irradiance than opaque, convective, yet sparser clouds in the ITCZ. Surface albedo estimates are realistic, generally not exceeding 0.06 in the ocean, as high as 0.9 in polar regions, and reaching 0.5 in the Sahara and Arabian deserts.},

	abstract = {The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is the first multisatellite system designed to measure the Earth's radiation budget. It will fly on a low-inclination NASA satellite and two Sun-synchronous NOAA satellites during the mid-1980s. Each satellite will carry two instrument packages—a scanner and a nonscanner—each package containing a complete, traceable system for inflight calibration. The nonscanner package has four Earth-viewing channels, as well as a solar monitor similar to that flown on the Solar Max Mission. The nonscanner detectors are the first Earth-viewing active cavity radiometers. The scanner package contains three thermistor bolometers which scan the Earth perpendicular to the orbital track. The data from the satellite radiometers will be brought to the top of the atmosphere using a pixel-by-pixel process for the scanner data and a numerical filter for the nonscanner. The inversion will use angular directional models based on the Nimbus 7 ERB instruments, selecting the appropriate model for cloud conditions from the ERBE scanner data. After the measurements have been brought to the top of the atmosphere, they will be averaged over time to produce monthly averages. In averaging, allowance will be made for meteorological variations, as well as albedo variations with solar zenith angle. These new features are expected to provide a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the radiation budget on regional as well as global scales. This paper also provides a brief description of the implementation of the ERBE Project, including the ERBE Science Team.},

	abstract = {Abstract Using in situ measurements of aerosol optical properties and ground-based measurements of aerosol optical thickness (τs) during the Smoke, Clouds and Radiation—Brazil (SCAR-B) experiment, a four-stream broadband radiative transfer model is used to estimate the downward shortwave irradiance (DSWI) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave aerosol radiative forcing (SWARF) in cloud-free regions dominated by smoke from biomass burning in Brazil. The calculated DSWI values are compared with broadband pyranometer measurements made at the surface. The results show that, for two days when near-coincident measurements of single-scattering albedo ω0 and τs are available, the root-mean-square errors between the measured and calculated DSWI for daytime data are within 30 W m−2. For five days during SCAR-B, however, when assumptions about ω0 have to be made and also when τs was significantly higher, the differences can be as large as 100 W m−2. At TOA, the SWARF per unit optical thickness ranges from −20 to −60 W m−2 over four major ecosystems in South America. The results show that τs and ω0 are the two most important parameters that affect DSWI calculations. For SWARF values, surface albedos also play an important role. It is shown that ω0 must be known within 0.05 and τs at 0.55 μm must be known to within 0.1 to estimate DSWI to within 20 W m−2. The methodology described in this paper could serve as a potential strategy for determining DSWI values in the presence of aerosols. The wavelength dependence of τs and ω0 over the entire shortwave spectrum is needed to improve radiative transfer calculations. If global retrievals of DSWI and SWARF from satellite measurements are to be performed in the presence of biomass-burning aerosols on a routine basis, a concerted effort should be made to develop methodologies for estimating ω0 and τs from satellite and ground-based measurements.},

	abstract = {Ground-based Sun photometer measurements, and airborne measurements of the physical and optical properties of regional hazes dominated by smoke from biomass burning in Brazil, are used for aerosol radiative vertical column and local radiative closure tests. Optical depths at midvisible wavelengths of up to 2.5 measured by two independent methods (ground-based Sun photometers and airborne measurements of the vertical profiles of aerosol optical extinction to the top of the smoke layer) agreed, on average, to within ∼20\%. Local aerosol closure tests were carried out using in situ measurements of particle size distributions as inputs to a computational model of the aerosol. Calculated aerosol masses, aerosol absorption and scattering coefficients, and the amounts of solar radiation backscattered by the aerosol were generally within 25\% of the measured values. The computational model was used to calculate a broader range of radiative transfer parameters, including aerosol mass scattering and absorption efficiencies, the asymmetry parameter, and upscatter fraction, across the solar spectrum. Regional values of direct aerosol radiative forcing produced by smoke aerosol in the cerrado and primary forest areas of Brazil are derived using the radiative transfer parameters as inputs to a radiative transfer model. The resulting net direct radiative forcing can result in either a cooling or a heating depending on the underlying surface albedo. Over a typical tropical forest the change in the daily average net shortwave flux per unit optical depth (at a wavelength of 550 nm) is −20 ± 7 W m−2 (where a negative value indicates cooling). Over the cerrado the forcing is −8± 9 W m−2, while over a dark surface, such as the ocean, the forcing is −26±6 W m−2. Over a reflective surface, such as a desert, we calculate a positive (heating) forcing of +25±12 W m−2.},

In 1997, Kiehl and Trenberth provided a review of past estimates and performed a number of radiative computations to better establish the role of clouds and various greenhouse gases in the overall radiative energy flows, with top-of-atmosphere (TOA) values constrained by Earth Radiation Budget Experiment values from 1985 to 1989, when the TOA values were approximately in balance. The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) measurements from March 2000 to May 2004 are used at TOA but adjusted to an estimated imbalance from the enhanced greenhouse effect of 0.9 W m−2. Revised estimates of surface turbulent fluxes are made based on various sources. The partitioning of solar radiation in the atmosphere is based in part on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) FD computations that utilize the global ISCCP cloud data every 3 h, and also accounts for increased atmospheric absorption by water vapor and aerosols. Surface upward longwave radiation is adjusted to account for spatial and temporal variability. A lack of closure in the energy balance at the surface is accommodated by making modest changes to surface fluxes, with the downward longwave radiation as the main residual to ensure a balance. Values are also presented for the land and ocean domains that include a net transport of energy from ocean to land of 2.2 petawatts (PW) of which 3.2 PW is from moisture (latent energy) transport, while net dry static energy transport is from land to ocean. Evaluations of atmospheric reanalyses reveal substantial biases.},

	abstract = {The NASA Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), flying aboard multiple satellites, is providing new insights into the climate system. Monthly averaged clear-sky and cloudy sky flux data derived from the ERBE are used to assess the impact of clouds on the Earth's radiation balance. This impact is examined in terms of three quantities: longwave, shortwave, and net cloud forcing. Overall, clouds appear to cool the Earth-atmosphere system. The global mean cooling varied from 14 to 21 W m−2 between April 1985 and January 1986. Hemispherically, the longwave and shortwave cloud forcing nearly cancel each other in the winter hemisphere, while in the summer the negative shortwave cloud forcing is significantly lower than the longwave cloud forcing, producing a strong cooling. Thus clouds significantly reduce the seasonal changes in the net radiative heating of the planet. This reduction is particularly strong over the mid- and high-latitude oceans, where they reduce the summer and spring solar heating by as much as 100–150 W m−2. In the low latitudes, the longwave and shortwave cloud forcing reach peak values over the convectively disturbed regions and tend to offset each other to a large extent. This feature, when combined with the large cooling effect over mid- and high-latitude oceans, leads to the conclusion that clouds significantly reduce the equator-to-pole radiative heating gradient of the planet during spring and summer. In the tropical convective regions the large magnitudes of the shortwave and longwave forcing and the near cancellation of the two suggest that clouds have a significant influence on the vertical distribution of heating between the atmosphere and the surface. Thus the ERBE data reveal that globally, hemispherically, and zonally, clouds have a significant effect on the radiative heating gradients. Comparisons of the ERBE results with general circulation models (GCMs) show that global net cloud forcing can be determined reasonably well from some current versions of the GCMs. Modeled regional and zonal values of radiative cloud forcing, however, indicate a need for considerable improvement.},

	abstract = {The study of climate and climate change is hindered by a lack of information on the effect of clouds on the radiation balance of the earth, referred to as the cloud-radiative forcing. Quantitative estimates of the global distributions of cloud-radiative forcing have been obtained from the spaceborne Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) launched in 1984. For the April 1985 period, the global shortwave cloud forcing [-44.5 watts per square meter (W/m2)] due to the enhancement of planetary albedo, exceeded in magnitude the longwave cloud forcing (31.3 W/m2) resulting from the greenhouse effect of clouds. Thus, clouds had a net cooling effect on the earth. This cooling effect is large over the mid- and high-latitude oceans, with values reaching -100 W/m2. The monthly averaged longwave cloud forcing reached maximum values of 50 to 100 W/m2 over the convectively disturbed regions of the tropics. However, this heating effect is nearly canceled by a correspondingly large negative shortwave cloud forcing, which indicates the delicately balanced state of the tropics. The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling. Hence, small changes in the cloud-radiative forcing fields can play a significant role as a climate feedback mechanism. For example, during past glaciations a migration toward the equator of the field of strong, negative cloud-radiative forcing, in response to a similar migration of cooler waters, could have significantly amplified oceanic cooling and continental glaciation.},

	abstract = {Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument, and a radiative transfer model (RTM), we provide a quantitative assessment of regional cloud-free diurnally averaged shortwave Aerosol Radiative Effects (AREs) at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and at the surface over Southeast Asia (SEAS, 10°S–20 N and 90°E–130°E). The spatial and temporal variations of the annual ARE are calculated based on satellite and ground-based measurements, supplemented by radiative transfer simulations. During 2001–2010, our results indicate that the TOA diurnally averaged ARE is −5.6 ± 0.8 Wm−2 over land and −4.8 ± 0.7 Wm−2 over ocean, respectively. In contrast, the surface ARE is −13.8 ± 3.2 Wm−2 based on radiative transfer calculations. For aerosol layers of 2 km in height with midvisible optical depth of 1.41 and single scattering albedo of 0.91, the shortwave radiative heating can exceed 0.8 K/day. Our results indicate signiﬁcant inter-annual variability of aerosol radiative properties, which is extremely large over major emission outﬂow regions like SEAS. This study suggests that an integrated system of satellite data, model calculations coupled with ground-based and meteorological data sets is needed to assess Aerosol Radiative Effects on regional earth-atmosphere energy budgets.},

	abstract = {Abstract Using satellite imagery, more than five million square kilometers of the forest and cerrado regions over South America are extensively studied to monitor fires and smoke during the 1985 biomass burning season. The results are characterized for four major ecosystems, namely, 1) tropical rain forest, 2) tropical broadleaf seasonal, 3) savanna/grass and seasonal woods (SGW), and 4) mild/warm/hot grass/shrub (MGS). The spatial and temporal distribution of fires are examined from two different methods using the multispectral Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Local Area Coverage data. Using collocated measurements from the instantaneous scanner Earth Radiation Budget Experiment data, the direct regional radiative forcing of biomass burning aerosols is computed. The results show that more than 70\% of the fires occur in the MGS and SGW ecosystems due to agricultural practices. The smoke generated from biomass burning has negative instantaneous net radiative forcing values for all four major ecosystems within South America. The smoke found directly over the fires has mean net radiative forcing values ranging from −25.6 to −33.9 W m−2. These results confirm that the regional net radiative impact of biomass burning is one of cooling. The spectral and broadband properties for clear-sky and smoke regions are also presented that could be used as input and/or validation for other studies attempting to model the impact of aerosols on the earth–atmosphere system. These results have important applications for future instruments from the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. Specifically, the combination of the Visible Infrared Scanner and Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission and the combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and CERES instruments from the EOS morning crossing mission could provide reliable estimates of the direct radiative forcing of aerosols on a global scale, thereby reducing the uncertainties in current global aerosol radiative forcing values.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) provides coincident global cloud and aerosol properties together with reflected solar, emitted terrestrial longwave, and infrared window radiative fluxes. These data are needed to improve the understanding and modeling of the interaction between clouds, aerosols, and radiation at the top of the atmosphere, surface, and within the atmosphere. This paper describes the approach used to estimate top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes from instantaneous CERES radiance measurements on the Terra satellite. A key component involves the development of empirical angular distribution models (ADMs) that account for the angular dependence of the earth’s radiation field at the TOA. The CERES Terra ADMs are developed using 24 months of CERES radiances, coincident cloud and aerosol retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and meteorological parameters from the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO)’s Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Data Assimilation System (DAS) V4.0.3 product. Scene information for the ADMs is from MODIS retrievals and GEOS DAS V4.0.3 properties over the ocean, land, desert, and snow for both clear and cloudy conditions. Because the CERES Terra ADMs are global, and far more CERES data are available on Terra than were available from CERES on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), the methodology used to define CERES Terra ADMs is different in many respects from that used to develop CERES TRMM ADMs, particularly over snow/sea ice, under cloudy conditions, and for clear scenes over land and desert.},

	abstract = {Abstract To estimate the earth's radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) from satellite-measured radiances, it is necessary to account for the finite geometry of the earth and recognize that the earth is a solid body surrounded by a translucent atmosphere of finite thickness that attenuates solar radiation differently at different heights. As a result, in order to account for all of the reflected solar and emitted thermal radiation from the planet by direct integration of satellite-measured radiances, the measurement viewing geometry must be defined at a reference level well above the earth's surface (e.g., 100 km). This ensures that all radiation contributions, including radiation escaping the planet along slant paths above the earth's tangent point, are accounted for. By using a field-of-view (FOV) reference level that is too low (such as the surface reference level), TOA fluxes for most scene types are systematically underestimated by 1–2 W m−2. In addition, since TOA flux represents a flow of radiant energy per unit area, and varies with distance from the earth according to the inverse-square law, a reference level is also needed to define satellite-based TOA fluxes. From theoretical radiative transfer calculations using a model that accounts for spherical geometry, the optimal reference level for defining TOA fluxes in radiation budget studies for the earth is estimated to be approximately 20 km. At this reference level, there is no need to explicitly account for horizontal transmission of solar radiation through the atmosphere in the earth radiation budget calculation. In this context, therefore, the 20-km reference level corresponds to the effective radiative “top of atmosphere” for the planet. Although the optimal flux reference level depends slightly on scene type due to differences in effective transmission of solar radiation with cloud height, the difference in flux caused by neglecting the scene-type dependence is less than 0.1\%. If an inappropriate TOA flux reference level is used to define satellite TOA fluxes, and horizontal transmission of solar radiation through the planet is not accounted for in the radiation budget equation, systematic errors in net flux of up to 8 W m−2 can result. Since climate models generally use a plane-parallel model approximation to estimate TOA fluxes and the earth radiation budget, they implicitly assume zero horizontal transmission of solar radiation in the radiation budget equation, and do not need to specify a flux reference level. By defining satellite-based TOA flux estimates at a 20-km flux reference level, comparisons with plane-parallel climate model calculations are simplified since there is no need to explicitly correct plane-parallel climate model fluxes for horizontal transmission of solar radiation through a finite earth.},

	abstract = {Abstract A new method for determining unfiltered shortwave (SW), longwave (LW), and window radiances from filtered radiances measured by the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) satellite instrument is presented. The method uses theoretically derived regression coefficients between filtered and unfiltered radiances that are a function of viewing geometry, geotype, and whether cloud is present. Relative errors in instantaneous unfiltered radiances from this method are generally well below 1\% for SW radiances (std dev ≈0.4\% or ≈1 W m−2 equivalent flux), less than 0.2\% for LW radiances (std dev ≈0.1\% or ≈0.3 W m−2 equivalent flux), and less than 0.2\% (std dev ≈0.1\%) for window channel radiances. When three months (June, July, and August of 1998) of CERES Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE)-like unfiltered radiances from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite between 20°S and 20°N are compared with archived Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) scanner measurements for the same months over a 5-yr period (1985–89), significant scene-type dependent differences are observed in the SW channel. Full-resolution CERES SW unfiltered radiances are ≈7.5\% (≈3 W m−2 equivalent diurnal average flux) lower than ERBS over clear ocean, as compared with ≈1.7\% (≈4 W m−2 equivalent diurnal average flux) for deep convective clouds and ≈6\% (≈4–6 W m−2 equivalent diurnal average flux) for clear land and desert. This dependence on scene type is shown to be partly caused by differences in spatial resolution between CERES and ERBS and by errors in the unfiltering method used in ERBS. When the CERES measurements are spatially averaged to match the ERBS spatial resolution and the unfiltering scheme proposed in this study is applied to both CERES and ERBS, the ERBS all-sky SW radiances increase by ≈1.7\%, and the CERES radiances are now consistently ≈3.5\%–5\% lower than the modified ERBS values for all scene types. Further study is needed to determine the cause for this remaining difference, and even calibration errors cannot be ruled out. CERES LW radiances are closer to ERBS values for individual scene types—CERES radiances are within ≈0.1\% (≈0.3 W m−2) of ERBS over clear ocean and ≈0.5\% (≈1.5 W m−2) over clear land and desert.},

	abstract = {This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we ﬁnd that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75\%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efﬁciently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3× or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8\%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pretraining and shows promising scaling behavior.},

From this characterization of the surface anisotropy, the algorithm performs angular integrations to derive intrinsic land surface albedos for each spectral band and three broad bands covering the solar spectrum. The albedo measures are a directional hemispherical re ectance  black sky albedo  obtained by integrating the BRDF over the exitance hemisphere for a single irradiance direction, and a bihemispherical re ectance  white sky albedo  obtained by integrating the BRDF over all viewing and irradiance directions. Because these albedo measures are purely properties of the surface and do not depend on the state of the atmosphere, they can be used with any atmospheric speci cation to provide true surface albedo as an input to regional and global climate models. The at-launch algorithm makes use of a linear kernel-based model the semiempirical reciprocal RossThick-LiSparse model. Validation of the BRDF model and its performance under conditions of sparse angular sampling and noisy re ectances shows that the retrievals obtained are generally reliable. The solar-zenith angle dependence of albedo may be parameterized by a simple polynomial that makes it unnecessary for the user to be familiar with the underlying BRDF model. Spectral-to-broadband conversion is achieved using banddependent weighting factors. The intrinsic land surface albedos may be used to derive actual albedo by taking into account the prevailing distribution of di use skylight.},

The Terra satellite has on-board exterior orientation (position and attitude) measurement systems designed to enable geolocation of MODIS data to approximately 150 m (1r) at nadir. A global network of ground control points is being used to determine biases and trends in the sensor orientation. Biases have been removed by updating models of the spacecraft and instrument orientation in the MODIS geolocation software several times since launch and have improved the MODIS geolocation to approximately 50 m (1r) at nadir. This paper overviews the geolocation approach, summarizes the first year of geolocation analysis, and overviews future work. The approach allows an operational characterization of the MODIS geolocation errors and enables individual MODIS observations to be geolocated to the sub-pixel accuracies required for terrestrial global change applications.},

The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings.},

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efﬁcient by ﬁtting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

	abstract = {Self-supervised learning guided by masked image modelling, such as Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), has attracted wide attention for pretraining vision transformers in remote sensing. However, MAE tends to excessively focus on pixel details, thereby limiting the model’s capacity for semantic understanding, in particular for noisy SAR images. In this paper, we explore spectral and spatial remote sensing image features as improved MAE-reconstruction targets. We first conduct a study on reconstructing various image features, all performing comparably well or better than raw pixels. Based on such observations, we propose Feature Guided Masked Autoencoder (FG-MAE): reconstructing a combination of Histograms of Oriented Graidents (HOG) and Normalized Difference Indices (NDI) for multispectral images, and reconstructing HOG for SAR images. Experimental results on three downstream tasks illustrate the effectiveness of FGMAE with a particular boost for SAR imagery. Furthermore, we demonstrate the well-inherited scalability of FG-MAE and release a first series of pretrained vision transformers for medium resolution SAR and multispectral images.},

This paper presents a machine learning method to estimate TOA OLR by directly linking Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) TOA radiances with TOA OLR determined by Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) and other information, such as the viewing geometry, land surface temperature and cloud top temperature determined by Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). Models are built separately under clear- and cloudy-sky conditions using a gradient boosting regression tree. Independent test results show that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the clear-sky and cloudy-sky models for estimating instantaneous values are 4.1 and 7.8 W/m2, respectively. Real-time conversion ratios derived from CERES daily and hourly OLR data are used to convert the instantaneous MODIS OLR to daily results. Inter-comparisons of the daily results show that the RMSE of the estimated MODIS OLR is 8.9 W/m2 in East Asia. The developed high resolution dataset will be beneficial in analyzing the regional energy budget.},

This data, however, often suffers from gaps in retrieval from sensor malfunction or atmospheric interference, particularly dense clouds that obscure parts or all of an area. For dynamic datasets such as the MCD19A2 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) dataset, gap filling is especially challenging. The difficulty lies in the often large, continuous blocks of cloudy pixels with missing data that limit the ability of spatial filling and the daily fluctuation in features such as AOD that incur high difficulty in gap filling from temporal trends. In this study, we propose a spatiotemporal long short-term memory (LSTM) convolutional autoencoder method that effectively reconstructs missing data resulting from thick cloud interference for MODIS AOD data. The proposed method outperforms previous methods of reconstructing data lost to thick cloud interference in AOD retrievals with a generalized network achieving a weighted average PSNR, SSIM, and R2 of 47.2, 0.992, and 0.941, respectively, between original, cloud-free days and those same days masked with simulated thick cloud interference without the need for additional covariates.},

	abstract = {Imaging spectrometers measure electromagnetic energy scattered in their instantaneous field view in hundreds or thousands of spectral channels with higher spectral resolution than multispectral cameras. Imaging spectrometers are therefore often referred to as hyperspectral cameras (HSCs). Higher spectral resolution enables material identification via spectroscopic analysis, which facilitates countless applications that require identifying materials in scenarios unsuitable for classical spectroscopic analysis. Due to low spatial resolution of HSCs, microscopic material mixing, and multiple scattering, spectra measured by HSCs are mixtures of spectra of materials in a scene. Thus, accurate estimation requires unmixing. Pixels are assumed to be mixtures of a few materials, called endmembers. Unmixing involves estimating all or some of: the number of endmembers, their spectral signatures, and their abundances at each pixel. Unmixing is a challenging, ill-posed inverse problem because of model inaccuracies, observation noise, environmental conditions, endmember variability, and data set size. Researchers have devised and investigated many models searching for robust, stable, tractable, and accurate unmixing algorithms. This paper presents an overview of unmixing methods from the time of Keshava and Mustard's unmixing tutorial to the present. Mixing models are first discussed. Signal-subspace, geometrical, statistical, sparsity-based, and spatial-contextual unmixing algorithms are described. Mathematical problems and potential solutions are described. Algorithm characteristics are illustrated experimentally.},

Particularly, the unsupervised unmixing method based on autoencoder (AE) has become a research hotspot. Most of the current AE unmixing networks mainly focus on information about pixels and their neighborhoods in images. However, they make insufficient use of information about spatial heterogeneity and spectral differences of endmembers in HSI data. To this end, an AE hyperspectral unmixing network with the name of SSF-Net is proposed for fusing the spatial-spectral features. The network first extracts pseudoendmember information from the HSI using a regional VCA algorithm. Then, a dual-branch feature fusion module incorporating a spatial-spectral attention mechanism is constructed to make full use of the information in the HSI data, thereby improving the network's unmixing performance. It is worth stating that SSF-Net can fuse spatial spectral information and utilize different attention maps to obtain more significant spectral difference information and more discriminative spatial difference information about the scene. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed SSF-Net outperforms state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI) data inherently has the ability to store finer details in the form of reflectance information through its contiguous spectral bands, which is utilized to discriminate between materials included in the data. With the emergence of deep learning (DL) over the last decade and the extent to which it has influenced applications and research in the domain of remote sensing is significant. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), residual networks (ResNets), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and other deep learning constructs have been employed to develop remote sensing-based computer vision applications, and have produced excellent results time and time again. However, the aforementioned deep learning constructs lack the intrinsic ability to prioritize data features based on how cardinal they are in mapping inputs to ground-truths, generally called attention, thus not exploiting the underlying architecture’s potential to the fullest. Hence, in this work, we explore the breadth of influence of a novel, computationally efficient visual transformer (ViT) based architecture on HSI data based classification tasks. The efficacy of the proposed architecture is evaluated through a series of experimentation and the performance is compared against other state-of-the-art attention based HSI data classification methodologies on two datasets, Salinas and Pavia University. When compared to other approaches discussed, experimental results show that our proposed methodology outperformed them in terms of classification efficacy and computational complexity under limited training samples scenario.},

	abstract = {A new bio-inspired optimization technique, named Manta Ray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) algorithm, is proposed and presented, aiming to providing a novel algorithm that provides an alternate optimization approach for addressing real-world engineering issues. The inspiration of this algorithm is based on intelligent behaviors of manta rays. This work mimics three unique foraging strategies of manta rays, including chain foraging, cyclone foraging, and somersault foraging, to develop an efficient optimization paradigm for solving different optimization problems. The performance of MRFO is evaluated, through comparisons with other state-of-the-art optimizers, on benchmark optimization functions and eight real-world engineering design cases. The comparison results on the benchmark functions suggest that MRFO is far superior to its competitors. In addition, the real-world engineering applications show the merits of this algorithm in tackling challenging problems in terms of computational cost and solution precision. The MATLAB codes of the MRFO algorithm are available at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/73130-manta-ray-foraging-optimization-mrfo.},

	abstract = {Clouds play a critical role in the Earth's energy budget and their potential changes are one of the largest uncertainties in future climate projections. However, the use of satellite observations to understand cloud feedbacks in a warming climate has been hampered by the simplicity of existing cloud classification schemes, which are based on single-pixel cloud properties rather than utilizing spatial structures and textures. Recent advances in computer vision enable the grouping of different patterns of images without using human-predefined labels, providing a novel means of automated cloud classification. This unsupervised learning approach allows discovery of unknown climate-relevant cloud patterns, and the automated processing of large datasets. We describe here the use of such methods to generate a new AI-driven Cloud Classification Atlas (AICCA), which leverages 22 years and 800 terabytes of MODIS satellite observations over the global ocean. We use a rotation-invariant cloud clustering (RICC) method to classify those observations into 42 AI-generated cloud class labels at {\textasciitilde}100 km spatial resolution. As a case study, we use AICCA to examine a recent finding of decreasing cloudiness in a critical part of the subtropical stratocumulus deck, and show that the change is accompanied by strong trends in cloud classes.},

	abstract = {The all-wave net radiation (Rn) at the land surface represents surface radiation budget and plays an important role in the Earth's energy and water cycles. Many studies have been conducted to estimate from satellite top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data using various methods, particularly the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). However, few studies have been conducted to provide a comprehensive evaluation about various ML and DL methods in retrieving. Based on extensive in situ measurements distributed at mid-low latitudes, the corresponding Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) TOA observations, and the daily from the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) used as a priori knowledge, this study assessed nine models for daily estimation, including six classic ML methods (random forest -RF, adaptive boosting - Adaboost, extreme gradient boosting -XGBoost, multilayer perceptron -MLP, radial basis function neural network -RBF, and support vector machine -SVM) and three DL methods (multilayer perceptron neural network with stacked autoencoders -SAE, deep belief network -DBN and residual neural network -ResNet). The validation results showed that the three DL methods were generally better than the six ML methods except XGBoost, although they all performed poorly in certain conditions such as winter days, rugged terrain, and high elevation. ResNet had the most robust performance across different land cover types, elevations, seasons, and latitude zones, but it has disadvantages in practice because of its highly configurable implementation environment and low computational efficiency. The estimated daily values from all nine models were more accurate than the corresponding Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) product.},

Features are employed as potential inputs for Long Short-Term Memory and a seq2seq SAELSTM autoencoder Deep Learning (DL) system in the final GSR prediction. Six solar energy farms in Queensland, Australia are considered to evaluate the method with predictors from Global Climate Models and ground-based observation. Comparisons are carried out among DL models (i.e., Deep Neural Network) and conventional Machine Learning algorithms (i.e., Gradient Boosting Regression, Random Forest Regression, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Adaptive Boosting Regression). The hyperparameters are deduced with grid search, and simulations demonstrate that the DL hybrid SAELSTM model is accurate compared with the other models as well as the persistence methods. The SAELSTM model obtains quality solar energy prediction intervals with high coverage probability and low interval errors. The review and new modelling results utilising an autoencoder deep learning method show that our approach is acceptable to predict solar radiation, and therefore is useful in solar energy monitoring systems to capture the stochastic variations in solar power generation due to cloud cover, aerosols, ozone changes, and other atmospheric attenuation factors.},

However, to our knowledge, to date there are no theoretical perspectives to explain the powerful expressivity of MAE. In this paper, we, for the ﬁrst time, propose a uniﬁed theoretical framework that provides a mathematical understanding for MAE. Speciﬁcally, we explain the patch-based attention approaches of MAE using an integral kernel under a non-overlapping domain decomposition setting. To help the research community to further comprehend the main reasons of the great success of MAE, based on our framework, we pose ﬁve questions and answer them with mathematical rigor using insights from operator theory.},

The combination of these models with visual attention techniques can assist with the identification of the most representative parts of the data from a visual standpoint, obtained through more detailed filtering of the features extracted by the operational layers of the network. This is of significant interest for analyzing remotely sensed hyperspectral images (HSIs), characterized by their very high spectral dimensionality. However, few efforts have been conducted in the literature in order to adapt visual attention methods to remotely sensed HSI data analysis. In this paper, we introduce a new visual attention-driven technique for the HSI classification. Specifically, we incorporate attention mechanisms to a ResNet in order to better characterize the spectral-spatial information contained in the data. Our newly proposed method calculates a mask that is applied to the features obtained by the network in order to identify the most desirable ones for classification purposes. Our experiments, conducted using four widely used HSI data sets, reveal that the proposed deep attention model provides competitive advantages in terms of classification accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised text encoding models have recently fueled substantial progress in NLP. The key idea is to use neural networks to convert words in texts to vector space representations based on word positions in a sentence and their contexts, which are suitable for end-to-end training of downstream tasks. We see a strikingly similar situation in spatial analysis, which focuses on incorporating both absolute positions and spatial contexts of geographic objects such as POIs into models. A general-purpose representation model for space is valuable for a multitude of tasks. However, no such general model exists to date beyond simply applying discretization or feed-forward nets to coordinates, and little effort has been put into jointly modeling distributions with vastly different characteristics, which commonly emerges from GIS data. Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning Neuroscience research shows that grid cells in mammals provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for location encoding and is critical for recognizing places and for path-integration. Therefore, we propose a representation learning model called Space2Vec to encode the absolute positions and spatial relationships of places. We conduct experiments on two real-world geographic data for two different tasks: 1) predicting types of POIs given their positions and context, 2) image classification leveraging their geo-locations. Results show that because of its multi-scale representations, Space2Vec outperforms well-established ML approaches such as RBF kernels, multi-layer feed-forward nets, and tile embedding approaches for location modeling and image classification tasks. Detailed analysis shows that all baselines can at most well handle distribution at one scale but show poor performances in other scales. In contrast, Space2Vec's multi-scale representation can handle distributions at different scales.},

One fundamental step is to encode a single point location into an embedding space, such that this embedding is learning-friendly for downstream machine learning models such as support vector machines and neural networks. We call this process location encoding. However, there lacks a systematic review on the concept of location encoding, its potential applications, and key challenges that need to be addressed. This paper aims to fill this gap. We first provide a formal definition of location encoding, and discuss the necessity of location encoding for GeoAI research from a machine learning perspective. Next, we provide a comprehensive survey and discussion about the current landscape of location encoding research. We classify location encoding models into different categories based on their inputs and encoding methods, and compare them based on whether they are parametric, multi-scale, distance preserving, and direction aware. We demonstrate that existing location encoding models can be unified under a shared formulation framework. We also discuss the application of location encoding for different types of spatial data. Finally, we point out several challenges in location encoding research that need to be solved in the future.},

We introduce a novel algorithm, Ã¸uralg , for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Ã¸uralg with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that Ã¸uralg can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.},

	abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

	abstract = {We present a new version (v5.0) of the NOAA Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) mid-tropospheric temperature (TMT) time series. This data set uses a backward-merging approach to intercalibrate 16 satellite-based microwave sounding records. The instrument observations included those from the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) during 1979–2004, Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) during 1998–2017, and Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) from 2011 to present. A TMT time series during 2002–present based on satellite microwave observations in stable sun-synchronous orbits was used as a reference in the backward merging process in which earlier satellites were adjusted and merged to the reference. Observations from earlier satellites were recalibrated to remove their calibration drifting errors relative to the reference using sequential overlapping observations. This included removal of spurious warming drifts in the MSU observations onboard NOAA-11, NOAA-12, and NOAA-14 and a spurious cooling drift in the NOAA-15 AMSU-A observations. Temperature changes resulting from diurnal sampling drifts were corrected using an observation-based semi-physical model developed in this study. Other adjustments included channel frequency differences between MSU and AMSU-A companion channels and instrument blackbody warm target effect on observed radiances. These adjustments resulted in inter-consistent TMT records spanning MSU, AMSU-A, and ATMS. The merged time series produced a global mean TMT trend of 0.092 ± 0.043 K/decade during 1979–2021 and a total tropospheric trend of 0.142 ± 0.045 K/decade after removal of a stratospheric cooling effect in TMT. Remarkably, the total tropospheric trends during the latest half period were nearly doubled the earlier half period over the global ocean.},

Off-the-shelf ML models, however, do not necessarily obey the fundamental governing laws of physical systems, nor do they generalize well to scenarios on which they have not been trained. We survey systematic approaches to incorporating physics and domain knowledge into ML models and distill these approaches into broad categories. Through 10 case studies, we show how these approaches have been used successfully for emulating, downscaling, and forecasting weather and climate processes. The accomplishments of these studies include greater physical consistency, reduced training time, improved data efficiency, and better generalization. Finally, we synthesize the lessons learned and identify scientific, diagnostic, computational, and resource challenges for developing truly robust and reliable physics-informed ML models for weather and climate processes.

	abstract = {Big data have become a critically enabling component of emerging mathematical methods aimed at the automated discovery of dynamical systems, where first principles modeling may be intractable. However, in many engineering systems, abrupt changes must be rapidly characterized based on limited, incomplete, and noisy data. Many leading automated learning techniques rely on unrealistically large data sets, and it is unclear how to leverage prior knowledge effectively to re-identify a model after an abrupt change. In this work, we propose a conceptual framework to recover parsimonious models of a system in response to abrupt changes in the low-data limit. First, the abrupt change is detected by comparing the estimated Lyapunov time of the data with the model prediction. Next, we apply the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) regression to update a previously identified model with the fewest changes, either by addition, deletion, or modification of existing model terms. We demonstrate this sparse model recovery on several examples for abrupt system change detection in periodic and chaotic dynamical systems. Our examples show that sparse updates to a previously identified model perform better with less data, have lower runtime complexity, and are less sensitive to noise than identifying an entirely new model. The proposed abrupt-SINDy architecture provides a new paradigm for the rapid and efficient recovery of a system model after abrupt changes.},

	abstract = {Recent progress in autoencoder-based sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) under \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ constraints allows joint discoveries of governing equations and latent coordinate systems from spatio-temporal data, including simulated video frames. However, it is challenging for \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-based sparse inference to perform correct identification for real data due to the noisy measurements and often limited sample sizes. To address the data-driven discovery of physics in the low-data and high-noise regimes, we propose Bayesian SINDy autoencoders, which incorporate a hierarchical Bayesian sparsifying prior: Spike-and-slab Gaussian Lasso. Bayesian SINDy autoencoder enables the joint discovery of governing equations and coordinate systems with a theoretically guaranteed uncertainty estimate. To resolve the challenging computational tractability of the Bayesian hierarchical setting, we adapt an adaptive empirical Bayesian method with Stochatic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) which gives a computationally tractable way of Bayesian posterior sampling within our framework. Bayesian SINDy autoencoder achieves better physics discovery with lower data and fewer training epochs, along with valid uncertainty quantification suggested by the experimental studies. The Bayesian SINDy autoencoder can be applied to real video data, with accurate physics discovery which correctly identifies the governing equation and provides a close estimate for standard physics constants like gravity \$g\$, for example, in videos of a pendulum.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

In this study, a new multiangle, multichannel data set that combines measurements from all three instruments is created to assess uncertainties in instantaneous shortwave (SW) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes inferred from CERES Angular Distribution Models (ADMs). MISR Level 1B2 ellipsoid-projected radiances from nine viewing directions in four spectral bands are merged with CERES by convolving the MISR radiances with the CERES Point Spread Function. The merged CERES-MISR data are then combined with the CERES Single Scanner Footprint TOA/Surface Fluxes and Clouds (SSF) product to produce the first merged CERES-MISR-MODIS data set. CERES and MISR data are used to generate narrow-to-broadband regression coefficients to convert narrowband MISR radiances to broadband SW radiances as a function of MODIS-based scene type. The regression uncertainty for all-sky conditions over ocean is approximately 4\%. Up to nine SW TOA fluxes for every CERES footprint are estimated by applying the CERES Terra ADMs to each MISR angle. Assuming that differences along the line-of-sight from the different MISR angles are small, the consistency of the TOA fluxes provides an indication of the instantaneous TOA flux uncertainty. The overall relative consistency of all-sky ocean TOA fluxes is 6\% (17 W m−2). When stratified by cloud type, TOA fluxes are consistent to 2–3\% ({\textless}10 W m−2) for moderately thick overcast clouds, which make up 15\% of the total population.},

	abstract = {High spatial resolution top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo data is needed to study the radiative forcing of natural or anthropogenic events at regional scales. However, existing products are typically estimated using broadband sensors with coarse spatial resolutions. This paper presents a hybrid method to retrieve TOA albedo over land from multispectral data collected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at its native spatial resolution. The approach is based on extensive atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) simulations using representative surface and atmospheric conditions as inputs. The clear-sky algorithm explicitly takes surface reflectance anisotropy into account using the POLDER3/PARASOL bidirectional reflectance distribution function database as the boundary condition of RT simulations to first generate TOA spectral albedos and then convert them to broadband albedo. In the cloudy-sky method, surfaces are assumed to be Lambertian and surface spectra over the shortwave spectrum are used to directly obtain TOA broadband albedo. The TOA albedo retrieved from MODIS was compared with the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) TOA flux products, using twelve days of global data (one day each month) in 2007. The two data sets are in good agreement, with a root mean square difference (RMSD) of 0.036 (8.6\%) for all Terra instantaneous data and 0.039 (9.1\%) for all Aqua instantaneous data. Further analysis revealed that larger discrepancies mainly occurred at pixels of large solar or view zenith angles. RMSD between the two data sets was reduced to {\textasciitilde}0.02 when the solar zenith angles were limited to 60° and the view zenith angles were limited to 30°.},

	abstract = {Abstract The vertically integrated global energy budget is evaluated with a direct and an indirect method (both corrected for mass inconsistencies of the forecast model), mainly using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis Interim (ERA-Interim) data. A new estimate for the net poleward total energy transport is given. Comparison to satellite-derived radiation data proves that ERA-Interim is better suited for investigation of interannual variations of the global energy budget than available satellite data since these either cover a relatively short period of time or are too inhomogeneous in time. While much improved compared to the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), regionally averaged energy budgets of ERA-Interim show that strong anomalies of forecasted vertical fluxes tend to be partly compensated by unrealistically large forecasted energy storage rates. Discrepancies between observed and forecasted monthly mean tendencies can be taken as rough measure for the uncertainties involved in the ERA-Interim energy budget. El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is shown to have large impact on regional energy budgets, but strong compensation occurs between the western and eastern Pacific, leading to only small net variations of the total poleward energy transports (similar magnitude as the uncertainty of the computations). However, Hovmöller longitude–time plots of tropical energy exports show relatively strong slowly eastward-moving poleward transport anomalies in connection with ENSO. Verification of these findings using independent estimates still needs to be done.},

	abstract = {Abstract Satellite and reanalysis data are used to observe interannual variations in atmospheric diabatic heating and circulation within the ascending and descending branches of the Hadley circulation (HC) during the past 12 yr. The column-integrated divergence of dry static energy (DSE) and kinetic energy is inferred from satellite-based observations of atmospheric radiation, precipitation latent heating, and reanalysis-based surface sensible heat flux for monthly positions of the HC branches, determined from a mass weighted zonal mean meridional streamfunction analysis. Mean surface radiative fluxes inferred from satellite and surface measurements are consistent to 1 W m−2 ({\textless}1\%) over land and 4 W m−2 (2\%) over ocean. In the ascending branch, where precipitation latent heating dominates over radiative cooling, discrepancies in latent heating among different precipitation datasets reach 22 W m−2 (17\%), compared to 3–6 W m−2 in the descending branches. Whereas direct calculations of DSE divergence from two reanalyses show opposite trends, the implied DSE divergence from the satellite observations of atmospheric diabatic heating exhibits no trend in all three HC branches and is strongly correlated (reaching 0.90) with midtropospheric vertical velocity. The implied DSE divergence from satellite observations thus provides a useful independent measure of HC circulation strength variability. The sensitivity to circulation change is 4–5 times larger for precipitation latent heating compared to atmospheric radiative cooling in the descending branches and 20 times larger in the ascending branch. The difference in sensitivity is due to cloud radiative effects, which enhance atmospheric radiative cooling in the descending branches in response to an increase in HC strength but decrease it in the ascending branch.},

	abstract = {The ocean interacts with the atmosphere via interfacial exchanges of momentum, heat (via radiation and convection), and fresh water (via evaporation and precipitation). These fluxes, or exchanges, constitute the ocean-surface energy and water budgets and define the ocean's role in Earth's climate and its variability on both short and long timescales. However, direct flux measurements are available only at limited locations. Air–sea fluxes are commonly estimated from bulk flux parameterization using flux-related near-surface meteorological variables (winds, sea and air temperatures, and humidity) that are available from buoys, ships, satellite remote sensing, numerical weather prediction models, and/or a combination of any of these sources. Uncertainties in parameterization-based flux estimates are large, and when they are integrated over the ocean basins, they cause a large imbalance in the global-ocean budgets. Despite the significant progress that has been made in quantifying surface fluxes in the past 30 years, achieving a global closure of ocean-surface energy and water budgets remains a challenge for flux products constructed from all data sources. This review provides a personal perspective on three questions: First, to what extent can time-series measurements from air–sea buoys be used as benchmarks for accuracy and reliability in the context of the budget closures? Second, what is the dominant source of uncertainties for surface flux products, the flux-related variables or the bulk flux algorithms? And third, given the coupling between the energy and water cycles, precipitation and surface radiation can act as twin budget constraints—are the community-standard precipitation and surface radiation products pairwise compatible?},

	abstract = {Satellite, reanalysis, and ocean in situ data are analyzed to evaluate regional, hemispheric and global mean trends in Earth's energy fluxes during the first 20 years of the twenty-first century. Regional trends in net top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5), and a model similar to ERA5 with prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice differ markedly, particularly over the Eastern Pacific Ocean, where CERES observes large positive trends. Hemispheric and global mean net TOA flux trends for the two reanalyses are smaller than CERES, and their climatological means are half those of CERES in the southern hemisphere (SH) and more than nine times larger in the northern hemisphere (NH). The regional trend pattern of the divergence of total atmospheric energy transport (TEDIV) over ocean determined using ERA5 analyzed fields is similar to that inferred from the difference between TOA and surface fluxes from ERA5 short-term forecasts. There is also agreement in the trend pattern over ocean for surface fluxes inferred as a residual between CERES net TOA flux and ERA5 analysis TEDIV and surface fluxes obtained directly from ERA5 forecasts. Robust trends are observed over the Gulf Stream associated with enhanced surface-to-atmosphere transfer of heat. Within the ocean, larger trends in ocean heating rate are found in the NH than the SH after 2005, but the magnitude of the trend varies greatly among datasets.},

	abstract = {Recent work in synthetic data generation in the time-series domain has focused on the use of Generative Adversarial Networks. We propose a novel architecture for synthetically generating time-series data with the use of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). The proposed architecture has several distinct properties: interpretability, ability to encode domain knowledge, and reduced training times. We evaluate data generation quality by similarity and predictability against four multivariate datasets. We experiment with varying sizes of training data to measure the impact of data availability on generation quality for our VAE method as well as several state-of-the-art data generation methods. Our results on similarity tests show that the VAE approach is able to accurately represent the temporal attributes of the original data. On next-step prediction tasks using generated data, the proposed VAE architecture consistently meets or exceeds performance of state-of-the-art data generation methods. While noise reduction may cause the generated data to deviate from original data, we demonstrate the resulting de-noised data can significantly improve performance for next-step prediction using generated data. Finally, the proposed architecture can incorporate domain-specific time-patterns such as polynomial trends and seasonalities to provide interpretable outputs. Such interpretability can be highly advantageous in applications requiring transparency of model outputs or where users desire to inject prior knowledge of time-series patterns into the generative model.},

	abstract = {Geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has emerged as a subfield of GIScience that uses artificial intelligence approaches and machine learning techniques for geographic knowledge discovery. The non-regularity of data structures has recently led to different variants of graph neural networks in the field of computer science, with graph convolutional neural networks being one of the most prominent that operate on non-euclidean structured data where the numbers of nodes connections vary and the nodes are unordered. These networks use graph convolution – commonly known as filters or kernels – in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers. This paper suggests spatial regression graph convolutional neural networks (SRGCNNs) as a deep learning paradigm that is capable of handling a wide range of geographical tasks where multivariate spatial data needs modeling and prediction. The feasibility of SRGCNNs lies in the feature propagation mechanisms, the spatial locality nature, and a semi-supervised training strategy. In the experiments, this paper demonstrates the operation of SRGCNNs with social media check-in data in Beijing and house price data in San Diego. The results indicate that a well-trained SRGCNN model is capable of learning from samples and performing reasonable predictions for unobserved locations. The paper also presents the effectiveness of incorporating the idea of geographically weighted regression for handling heterogeneity between locations in the model approach. Compared to conventional spatial regression approaches, SRGCNN-based models tend to generate much more accurate and stable results, especially when the sampling ratio is low. This study offers to bridge the methodological gap between graph deep learning and spatial regression analytics. The proposed idea serves as an example to illustrate how spatial analytics can be combined with state-of-the-art deep learning models, and to enlighten future research at the front of GeoAI.},

The imputation MSE on test data is reduced by 12.18\%-48.02\% when compared to using the raw data. An analysis of the features and weights learned via tiled CNNs and DAs explains why the approaches work.},

The detailed spectral resolution is useful for many image analysis problems, but it comes at the cost of much lower spatial resolution. Hyperspectral super-resolution addresses this problem, by fusing a low-resolution hyperspectral image and a conventional high-resolution image into a product of both high spatial and high spectral resolution. In this paper, we propose a method which performs hyperspectral super-resolution by jointly unmixing the two input images into the pure reflectance spectra of the observed materials and the associated mixing coefficients. The formulation leads to a coupled matrix factorisation problem, with a number of useful constraints imposed by elementary physical properties of spectral mixing. In experiments with two benchmark datasets we show that the proposed approach delivers improved hyperspectral super-resolution.},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional networks based super-resolution is a fast-growing ﬁeld with numerous practical applications. In this exposition, we extensively compare more than 30 state-of-the-art super-resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over three classical and three recently introduced challenging datasets to benchmark single image super-resolution. We introduce a taxonomy for deep-learning based super-resolution networks that groups existing methods into nine categories including linear, residual, multi-branch, recursive, progressive, attention-based and adversarial designs. We also provide comparisons between the models in terms of network complexity, memory footprint, model input and output, learning details, the type of network losses and important architectural differences (e.g., depth, skip-connections, ﬁlters). The extensive evaluation performed, shows the consistent and rapid growth in the accuracy in the past few years along with a corresponding boost in model complexity and the availability of large-scale datasets. It is also observed that the pioneering methods identiﬁed as the benchmark have been signiﬁcantly outperformed by the current contenders. Despite the progress in recent years, we identify several shortcomings of existing techniques and provide future research directions towards the solution of these open problems.

An original model assumption that there is no significant heat transfer during redistribution of liquid water was relaxed by including a source/sink term in the heat transfer equation to account for latent heat during phase transitions of soil moisture. The parameterization uses the layer-integrated form of heat and water diffusion equations adopted by the original Eta-LSS. Therefore it simulates the total ice content of each selected soil layer. Infiltration reduction under frozen ground conditions was estimated by probabilistic averaging of spatially variable ice content of the soil profile. Off-line uncoupled tests of the new and original Eta-LSS were performed using experimental data from Rosemount, Minnesota. Simulated soil temperature and unfrozen water content matched observed data reasonably well. Neglecting frozen ground processes leads to significant underestimation/overestimation of soil temperature during soil freezing/thawing periods and underestimates total soil moisture content after extensive periods of soil freezing.},

	abstract = {The Noah model is a land surface model of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. It has been widely used in regional coupled weather and climate models (i.e. Weather Research and Forecasting Model, Eta Mesoscale Model) and global coupled weather and climate models (i.e. National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System, Climate Forecast System). Therefore, its continued improvement and development are keys to enhancing our weather and climate forecast ability and water and energy flux simulation accuracy. North American Land Data Assimilation System phase 1 (NLDAS-1) experiments indicated that the Noah model exhibited substantial bias in latent heat flux, total runoff and land skin temperature during the warm season, and such bias can significantly affect coupled weather and climate models. This paper presents a study to improve the Noah model by adding model parameterization processes such as including seasonal factor on leaf area index and root distribution and selecting optimal model parameters. We compared simulated latent heat flux, mean annual runoff and land skin temperature from the Noah control and test versions with measured latent heat flux, land surface skin temperature, mean annual runoff and satellite-retrieved land surface skin temperature. The results show that the test version significantly reduces biases in latent heat, total runoff and land skin temperature simulation. The test version has been used for the NLDAS phase 2 (NLDAS-2) to produce 30-year water flux, energy flux and state variable products to support the US drought monitor of National Integrated Drought Information System.

The four LSMs are the baseline community Noah LSM (Noah, version 2.8), the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC, version 4.0.5) model, the substantially augmented Noah LSM with multiparameterization options (hence Noah-MP), and the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4). All four models are driven by the same NLDAS-2 atmospheric forcing. Modeled terrestrial water storage (TWS), streamflow, evapotranspiration (ET), and soil moisture are compared with each other and evaluated against the identical observations. Relative to Noah, the other three models offer significant improvements in simulating TWS and streamflow and moderate improvements in simulating ET and soil moisture. Noah-MP provides the best performance in simulating soil moisture and is among the best in simulating TWS, CLM4 shows the best performance in simulating ET, and VIC ranks the highest in performing the streamflow simulations. Despite these improvements, CLM4, Noah-MP, and VIC exhibit deficiencies, such as the low variability of soil moisture in CLM4, the fast growth of spring ET in Noah-MP, and the constant overestimation of ET in VIC.},

Model reduction of linear, nonparametric dynamical systems has reached a considerable level of maturity, as reﬂected by several survey papers and books. However, parametric model reduction has emerged only more recently as an important and vibrant research area, with several recent advances making a survey paper timely.

	abstract = {Abstract The North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD) was initiated in 2011 to provide support for developing climate forecasting tools, calibrating land surface models, and validating satellite-derived soil moisture algorithms. The NASMD has collected data from over 30 soil moisture observation networks providing millions of in situ soil moisture observations in all 50 states, as well as Canada and Mexico. It is recognized that the quality of measured soil moisture in NASMD is highly variable because of the diversity of climatological conditions, land cover, soil texture, and topographies of the stations, and differences in measurement devices (e.g., sensors) and installation. It is also recognized that error, inaccuracy, and imprecision in the data can have significant impacts on practical operations and scientific studies. Therefore, developing an appropriate quality control procedure is essential to ensure that the data are of the best quality. In this study, an automated quality control approach is developed using the North American Land Data Assimilation System, phase 2 (NLDAS-2), Noah soil porosity, soil temperature, and fraction of liquid and total soil moisture to flag erroneous and/or spurious measurements. Overall results show that this approach is able to flag unreasonable values when the soil is partially frozen. A validation example using NLDAS-2 multiple model soil moisture products at the 20-cm soil layer showed that the quality control procedure had a significant positive impact in Alabama, North Carolina, and west Texas. It had a greater impact in colder regions, particularly during spring and autumn. Over 433 NASMD stations have been quality controlled using the methodology proposed in this study, and the algorithm will be implemented to control data quality from the other {\textasciitilde}1200 NASMD stations in the near future.},

The results show that these impacts are significant for most regions and soil layers, although they vary depending on soil texture classification, vegetation type, and season. The use of site-observed soil texture classification and vegetation type in the model does not necessarily improve anomaly correlations and reduce mean absolute error for soil moisture simulations. Instead, results are mixed when examining all regions and soil layers. This is attributed to the compensation effects (e.g., effect of ill-calibrated model parameters), as Noah has been more or less calibrated with model-specified soil texture classification and vegetation type. The site-based analysis shows that Noah can reasonably simulate the variation of daily evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and total runoff when soil texture classification (vegetation type) is corrected from loam (forest) to clay (grasslands) or vice versa. This suggests that the performance of Noah can be further improved by tuning model parameters when site-observed soil texture and vegetation type are used.},

The four land surface models, including Noah, Mosaic, Sacramento soil moisture accounting (SAC), and the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC), were run within phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2), with a ⅛° spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution. Hundreds of sites in Alabama, Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, West Texas, and Utah were used to evaluate simulated soil moisture in the 0–10-, 10–40-, and 40–100-cm soil layers. Soil moisture was spatially averaged in each state to reduce noise. In general, the four models captured broad features (e.g., seasonal variation) of soil moisture variations in all three soil layers in seven states, except for the 10–40-cm soil layer in West Texas and the 40–100-cm soil layer in Alabama, where the anomaly correlations are weak. Overall, Mosaic, SAC, and the ensemble mean have the highest simulation skill and VIC has the lowest simulation skill. The results show that Noah and VIC are wetter than the observations while Mosaic and SAC are drier than the observations, mostly likely because of systematic errors in model evapotranspiration.},

The soil moisture data from these models have been used for operational drought monitoring activities, but so far have not yet been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, three available in situ soil moisture observation data sets in the United States were used to evaluate the model-simulated soil moisture for different time scales varying from daily to annual. First, we used the observed multiple layer monthly and annual mean soil moisture from the Illinois Climate Network to evaluate 20-years (January 1985–December 2004) of model-simulated soil moisture in terms of skill and analysis of error statistics. Second, we utilized 6-years (1 January 1997–31 December 2002) of daily soil moisture observed from 72 sites over the Oklahoma Mesonet network to assess daily and monthly simulation skill and errors for 3 model soil layers (0–10cm, 10–40cm, 40–100cm). Third, we extended the daily assessment to sites over the continental United States using 8-years (1 January 2002–31 December 2009) of observations for 121 sites from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). Overall, all models are able to capture wet and dry events and show high skill (in most cases, anomaly correlation is larger than 0.7), but display large biases when compared to in situ observations. These errors may come from model errors (i.e., model structure error, model parameter error), forcing data errors, and in situ soil moisture measurement errors. For example, all models simulate less soil moisture due to lack of modeled irrigation and ground water processes in Illinois, Oklahoma, and the other Midwest states.},

	abstract = {With unprecedented attention on global change, the current debate revolves around the availability and sustainability of natural resources and how to achieve equilibrium between what society demands from natural environments and what the natural resource base can provide. A full understanding of the range of issues, from the consequences of the changing resource bases to the degradation of ecological integrity and the sustainability of life, is crucial to the process of developing solutions to this complex challenge. Authored by world-class scientists and scholars, The Encyclopedia of Natural Resources provides an authoritative reference on a broad spectrum of topics such as the forcing factors and habitats of life; their histories, current status, and future trends; and their societal connections, economic values, and management. The content presents state-of-the-art science and technology development and perspectives of resource management. Written and designed with a broad audience in mind, the entries clearly elucidate the issues for readers at all levels. Volume I ? Land includes 98 entries that cover the topical areas of renewable and nonrenewable natural resources such as forest and vegetative; soil; terrestrial coastal and inland wetlands; landscape structure and function and change; biological diversity; ecosystem services, protected areas, and management; natural resource economics; and resource security and sustainability. In Volume II, Water includes 59 entries and Air includes 31 entries. The Water entries cover topical areas such as fresh water, groundwater, water quality and watersheds, ice and snow, coastal environments, and marine resources and economics. The Air entries cover air pollutants, atmospheric oscillation, circulation patterns and atmospheric water storage, as well as agroclimatology, climate change, and extreme events. Additional topics in meteorology include acid rain, drought, ozone depletion, water storage, and more. Natural resources represent such a broad scope of complex and challenging topics that a reference book must cover a vast number of subjects in order to be titled an encyclopedia. The Encyclopedia of Natural Resources does just that. The topics covered help readers face current and future issues in the maintenance of clean air and water as well as the preservation of land resources and native biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component of the surface hydrological cycle and controls land-atmosphere feedbacks by modulating the surface energy budget. Accurate ET quantification at global or regional scales is crucial for understanding variations in carbon and water cycling in a changing environment. Although various grid-based ET data models have been developed using multiple approaches, these vary in concept and physical scheme, leading to differences in performance. We examine uncertainties associated with the limitations of the physics used to assist in model selection and improvement. We evaluate multiple ET data models, including estimates derived from a variety of land surface models (LSMs) based on the operational North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) phase 2 (NLDAS-2) and the experimental NASA LIS-based NLDAS Testbed (NLDAS-Testbed) drivers, and satellite retrievals, compared to water budget-derived ET and tower observations. Overall, all models are able to capture the spatial variability of mean annual water balance-based ET (ETwb) and monthly seasonal cycles of tower ET measurements, although there is a large range of estimates. NOAH28, FLUXNET, SSEBop, LandFlux, and GLEAM perform best, as demonstrated by their higher correlation and smaller bias and RMSE values. Simple relative uncertainty analysis shows that the NLDAS-Testbed ensemble mean has a slightly lower uncertainty than that of the NLDAS-2 ensemble. Our study indicates that NLDAS-Testbed/VIC412 (NLDAS version/LSM version) is improving and NLDAS-Testbed /CLSM is deteriorating relative to NLDAS-2/VIC403 and NLDAS-2/Mosaic. NLDAS-Testbed /NOAH36 and NLDAS-Testbed /NOAHMP36 are comparable to NLDAS-2/NOAH28, although biases between models and ETwb exhibit opposite trends. These findings will help further improvement of these models and support future NLDAS development.},

Land surface evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most important model outputs from NLDAS-2 for investigating land–atmosphere interaction or to monitor agricultural drought. Here, we evaluate hourly ET using in situ observations over the Southern Great Plains (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement/Cloud and Radiation Testbed network) for 1 January 1997–30 September 1999 and daily ET u-sing in situ observations at the AmeriFlux network over the conterminous USA for an 8-year period (2000–2007). The NLDAS-2 models compare well against observations, with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's Noah land surface model performing best, followed, in order, by the Variable Infiltration Capacity, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting, and Mosaic models. Daily evaluation across the AmeriFlux network shows that for all models, performance depends on season and vegetation type; they do better in spring and fall than in winter or summer and better for deciduous broadleaf forest and grasslands than for croplands or evergreen needleleaf forest.

	abstract = {AbstractProliferation of evapotranspiration (ET) products warrants comparison of these products. The study objective was to assess uncertainty in ET output from four land surface models (LSMs), Noah, Mosaic, VIC, and SAC in NLDAS-2, two remote sensing-based products, MODIS and AVHRR, and GRACE-inferred ET from a water budget with precipitation from PRISM, monitored runoff, and total water storage change (TWSC) from GRACE satellites. The three cornered hat method, which does not require a priori knowledge of the true ET value, was used to estimate ET uncertainties. In addition, TWSC or total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE was compared with water budget estimates of TWSC from a flux-based approach or TWSA from a storage-based approach. The analyses were conducted using data from three regions (humid-arid) in the South Central United States as case studies. Uncertainties in ET are lowest in LSM ET (∼5 mm/mo), moderate in MODIS or AVHRR-based ET (10–15 mm/mo), and highest in GRACE-inferred ET (20–30 mm/month). There is a trade-off between spatial resolution and uncertainty, with lower uncertainty in the coarser-resolution LSM ET (∼14 km) relative to higher uncertainty in the finer-resolution (∼1–8 km) RS ET. Root-mean-square (RMS) of uncertainties in water budget estimates of TWSC is about half of RMS of uncertainties in GRACE-derived TWSC for each of the regions. Future ET estimation should consider a hybrid approach that integrates strengths of LSMs and satellite-based products to constrain uncertainties.},

This article provides a historical perspective on international LSM intercomparison efforts and the development of LDASs, both of which have improved LSM ET skill. In addition, an assessment of ET estimates for current LDASs is provided along with current research that demonstrates improvement in LSM ET estimates due to assimilating satellite-based soil moisture products. Using the Ensemble Kalman Filter in the Land Information System, we assimilate both NASA and Land Parameter Retrieval Model soil moisture products into the Noah LSM Version 3.2 with the North American LDAS Phase 2 (NLDAS-2), forcing to mimic the NLDAS-2 configuration. Through comparisons with two global reference ET products, one based on interpolated flux tower data and one from a new satellite ET algorithm, over the NLDAS-2 domain, we demonstrate improvement in ET estimates only when assimilating the LPRM soil moisture product.

	abstract = {Results are presented from the second phase of the multiinstitution North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2) research partnership. In NLDAS, the Noah, Variable Infiltration Capacity, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting, and Mosaic land surface models (LSMs) are executed over the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) in realtime and retrospective modes. These runs support the drought analysis, monitoring and forecasting activities of the National Integrated Drought Information System, as well as efforts to monitor large-scale floods. NLDAS-2 builds upon the framework of the first phase of NLDAS (NLDAS-1) by increasing the accuracy and consistency of the surface forcing data, upgrading the land surface model code and parameters, and extending the study from a 3-year (1997–1999) to a 30-year (1979–2008) time window. As the first of two parts, this paper details the configuration of NLDAS-2, describes the upgrades to the forcing, parameters, and code of the four LSMs, and explores overall model-to-model comparisons of land surface water and energy flux and state variables over the CONUS. Focusing on model output rather than on observations, this study seeks to highlight the similarities and differences between models, and to assess changes in output from that seen in NLDAS-1. The second part of the two-part article focuses on the validation of model-simulated streamflow and evaporation against observations. The results depict a higher level of agreement among the four models over much of the CONUS than was found in the first phase of NLDAS. This is due, in part, to recent improvements in the parameters, code, and forcing of the NLDAS-2 LSMs that were initiated following NLDAS-1. However, large inter-model differences still exist in the northeast, Lake Superior, and western mountainous regions of the CONUS, which are associated with cold season processes. In addition, variations in the representation of sub-surface hydrology in the four LSMs lead to large differences in modeled evaporation and subsurface runoff. These issues are important targets for future research by the land surface modeling community. Finally, improvement from NLDAS-1 to NLDAS-2 is summarized by comparing the streamflow measured from U.S. Geological Survey stream gauges with that simulated by four NLDAS models over 961 small basins.},

	abstract = {This is the second part of a study on continental-scale water and energy flux analysis and validation conducted in phase 2 of the North American Land Data Assimilation System project (NLDAS-2). The first part concentrates on a model-by-model comparison of mean annual and monthly water fluxes, energy fluxes and state variables. In this second part, the focus is on the validation of simulated streamflow from four land surface models (Noah, Mosaic, Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA), and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) models) and their ensemble mean. Comparisons are made against 28-years (1 October 1979–30 September 2007) of United States Geological Survey observed streamflow for 961 small basins and 8 major basins over the conterminous United States (CONUS). Relative bias, anomaly correlation and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) statistics at daily to annual time scales are used to assess model-simulated streamflow. The Noah (the Mosaic) model overestimates (underestimates) mean annual runoff and underestimates (overestimates) mean annual evapotranspiration. The SAC-SMA and VIC models simulate the mean annual runoff and evapotranspiration well when compared with the observations. The ensemble mean is closer to the mean annual observed streamflow for both the 961 small basins and the 8 major basins than is the mean from any individual model. All of the models, as well as the ensemble mean, have large daily, weekly, monthly, and annual streamflow anomaly correlations for most basins over the CONUS, implying strong simulation skill. However, the daily, weekly, and monthly NSE analysis results are not necessarily encouraging, in particular for daily streamflow. The Noah and Mosaic models are useful (NSE {\textgreater} 0.4) only for about 10\% of the 961 small basins, the SAC-SMA and VIC models are useful for about 30\% of the 961 small basins, and the ensemble mean is useful for about 42\% of the 961 small basins. As the time scale increases, the NSE increases as expected. However, even for monthly streamflow, the ensemble mean is useful for only 75\% of the 961 small basins.},

Here, the exact, explicit, analytic expression is derived for an air parcel’s LCL as a function of its temperature and relative humidity. Unlike previous analytic expressions, some of which can have errors as high as hundreds or thousands of meters, this exact expression is accurate to within the uncertainty of empirical vapor pressure measurements: this translates into an uncertainty of around 5 m for all temperatures and relative humidities. An exact, explicit, analytic expression for the lifting deposition level (LDL) is also derived, and its behavior is compared to the LCL. At sufficiently cold temperatures, aerosols freeze homogeneously below the LCL; an approximate, implicit, analytic expression is given for this lifting freezing level (LFL). By comparing the LCL, LDL, and LFL, it is found that a well-mixed boundary layer can have an ice-supersaturated layer that is no thicker than 400 m.},

While often effective, this decoupling requires specifying two separate models, each with their own complexities, and prevents capturing more nuanced long-range spatiotemporal relationships. We propose a unified approach, as demonstrated by our Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), that hierarchically captures relationships at low-, intermediate-, and high-level time-scales. Our model achieves superior or competitive performance using video or sensor data on three public action segmentation datasets and can be trained in a fraction of the time it takes to train an RNN.},

Proof of the existence and uniqueness of solution was given only in 1983 by Alt and Luckhaus.  The equation is based on Darcy-Buckingham law representing flow in porous media under variably saturated conditions, which is stated as

On the other hand, the band ratio method, which uses near-infrared and visible bands, assigns considerably more ice phase compared to the brightness temperature difference method and leads to discrepancies with the expectations based on the cloud top radiative temperature. When the cloud phase algorithm, developed originally for the Department of Energy Multispectral Thermal Imager research satellite, is applied to the MODIS imagery, the cloud phase assignments are close to the brightness temperature difference results and are in better agreement with the expectations based on the cloud top radiative temperature.},

	abstract = {Neural-based multi-task learning has been successfully used in many real-world large-scale applications such as recommendation systems. For example, in movie recommendations, beyond providing users movies which they tend to purchase and watch, the system might also optimize for users liking the movies afterwards. With multi-task learning, we aim to build a single model that learns these multiple goals and tasks simultaneously. However, the prediction quality of commonly used multi-task models is often sensitive to the relationships between tasks. It is therefore important to study the modeling tradeoffs between task-specific objectives and inter-task relationships. In this work, we propose a novel multi-task learning approach, Multi-gate Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE), which explicitly learns to model task relationships from data. We adapt the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure to multi-task learning by sharing the expert submodels across all tasks, while also having a gating network trained to optimize each task. To validate our approach on data with different levels of task relatedness, we first apply it to a synthetic dataset where we control the task relatedness. We show that the proposed approach performs better than baseline methods when the tasks are less related. We also show that the MMoE structure results in an additional trainability benefit, depending on different levels of randomness in the training data and model initialization. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance improvements by MMoE on real tasks including a binary classification benchmark, and a large-scale content recommendation system at Google.},

	abstract = {Bayesian estimation of finite Gamma mixture model (GaMM) has attracted considerable attention recently due to its capability of modeling positive data. With conventional variational inference (VI) frameworks, we cannot derive an analytically tractable solution for the variational posterior, since the expectation of the joint distribution of all the random variables cannot be estimated in a closed form. Therefore, numerical techniques are commonly utilized to simulate the posterior distribution. However, the optimization process of these methods can be prohibitively slow for practical applications. In order to obtain closed-form solutions, some lower-bound approximations are then introduced into the evidence lower bound (ELBO), following the recently proposed extended variational inference (EVI) framework. The problem in numerical simulation can be overcome. In this paper, we address the Bayesian estimation of the finite Gamma mixture model (GaMM) under the EVI framework in a flexible way. Moreover, the optimal mixture component number can be automatically determined based on the observed data and the over-fitting problem related to the conventional expectation–maximization (EM) is overcome. We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method with synthesized data and real data evaluations. In the real data evaluation, we compare the proposed method on object detection and image categorization tasks with referred methods and find statistically significant improvement on accuracies and runtime.},

	abstract = {Scanning radiometers on satellites have a finite response time, because of the detector and the associated electronics. The radiometer measurement as it scans over a point source of radiation of unit strength is the point spread function (PSF). The time response causes a widening and skewing of the PSF. The PSF of a scanning radiometer that has well-focused optics together with time responses for the detector and electronic filter is treated in the time domain. The PSF can be expressed in terms of the system time response to a step input. For a first-order system time response, the displacement of the centroid is the product of the system time constant and the scan rate of the radiometer. The electronic filter further displaces the centroid of the PSF by the product of the scan rate and the filter time constant. Also, the width of the PSF in the scan direction will be increased because of the system time response. The minimum resolvable feature is of the order of the width of the PSF, thus the system time response limits the resolution in the scan direction that can be obtained. The analysis is illustrated by applying it to the Clouds and Earth Radiant Energy System experiment scanning radiometer.},

First, we locate the imager pixels that are within the CERES footprint. Since CERES has a rotating azimuth plane scanner, the collocation algorithm must be capable of handling an elongated and skewed footprint. We then determine the cloud statistics over the footprint with the cloud properties from the high resolution imager cloud properties. Our statistics are weighted means and standard deviations where the weighting is the value of the point spread function (PSF).

	abstract = {Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5\${\textbackslash}times\$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.},

	abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is a key diagnostic indicator of agricultural water use and crop stress. LST data retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) band imagery, however, tend to have a coarser spatial resolution (e.g., 100 m for Landsat 8) than surface reflectance (SR) data collected from shortwave bands on the same instrument (e.g., 30 m for Landsat). Spatial sharpening of LST data using the higher resolution multi-band SR data provides an important path for improved agricultural monitoring at sub-field scales. A previously developed Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) approach has shown great potential in the sharpening of Landsat LST using Landsat SR data co-collected over various landscapes. This work evaluates DMS performance for sharpening ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) LST ({\textasciitilde}70 m native resolution) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LST (375 m) data using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) SR data, providing the basis for generating 30-m LST data at a higher temporal frequency than afforded by Landsat alone. To account for the misalignment between ECOSTRESS/VIIRS and Landsat/HLS caused by errors in registration and orthorectification, we propose a modified version of the DMS approach that employs a relaxed box size for energy conservation (EC). Sharpening experiments were conducted over three study sites in California, and results were evaluated visually and quantitatively against LST data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) flights and from Landsat 8. Over the three sites, the modified DMS technique showed improved sharpening accuracy over the standard DMS for both ECOSTRESS and VIIRS, suggesting the effectiveness of relaxing EC box in relieving misalignment-induced errors. To achieve reasonable accuracy while minimizing loss of spatial detail due to the EC box size increase, an optimal EC box size of 180–270 m was identified for ECOSTRESS and about 780 m for VIIRS data based on experiments from the three sites. Results from this work will facilitate the development of a prototype system that generates high spatiotemporal resolution LST products for improved agricultural water use monitoring by synthesizing multi-source remote sensing data.},
